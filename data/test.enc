Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Why?
You got something on your mind?
Sure have.
Have fun tonight?
They do to!
Hey, sweet cheeks.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
He was, like, a total babe
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
That's not
So -- which Dakota you from?
That girl -- I --
What makes you think he'll do it?
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
Will Bogey get bent?
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
What'd you do to her?
You makin' any headway?
What's the worst?
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Where ya goin?
You need money to take a girl out
It's about time.
Hey.
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
William didn't even go to high school
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
You didn't
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
You're not a big talker, are you?
hey.  Great show, huh?
Okay?
This is so patronizing.
I thought you were above all that
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
No, you weren't
Start a band?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
Wholesome.
Put your right foot there --
A soft side? Who knew?
Tell me something true.
No, I won't go with you
I know.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
What plan?
What?!
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Have a great time, honey!
Did I have anything to say about it?
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
We should have seen land.
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
I have to explore the mainland.
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
Say not here!  Cuba!
... and also to bring medicine.
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
God... That's in a week!
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
Esdras is a Jew.
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
All of them!  Just lies!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
I believed in you...
I suppose we're both old men now.
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
How old are you, Senor Colon?
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
What do you read?
What's he doing?
We're lost!
You tell that to them!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
... Into a monk...
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
Your mother was blind?
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
Did you ever turn tricks before?
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
Is he your boyfriend?
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
What's he looking for?
What's wrong?
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
I don't even watch TV.
I'll come with you.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
Two heads.
Why not?
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
How many victims are up there?
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Alright.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
Yeah.
Promise?
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
Okay.  You ready?
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
Where's your partner?
Tell him to put his gun down!
Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
We are both from Prague.
Who is he?
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Did you hear what I said?
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
How you erase this?
I did.
Why not?
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
Well, he...
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
You okay?
Yeah?  What kind?
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
CONTINUED
Okay. 
Oh?
Yes, I thought so.
How?
Well, that's something.
Good morning. How's it going?
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
CONTINUED
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
That's true
Roger.
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
I don't give a damn about his girl...
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
Hello, again.
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
How about it?
You lying son of a bitch...
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
Yeah, I noticed...
You're crazy.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
Bullshit.
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
What do you think?
I don't give out the details.
Well?
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
Let's go.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
Half a million.
We split 50-50?
Where's the goddamn car?
What?
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
Yeah, I see her.
That was quick.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
It's late, they're closing...
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
You okay?
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
Yeah?
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
You look awful.
Bullshit red tape.
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
A cop...
I'm all wet.
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Thanks for the coffee.
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
How do you know?
Three more hours...
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
You chickenshit punk...
Five.  On credit.
What're you laughing about?
...We're saved!
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
Is there anything that can stop it?
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
Do you love her?
Yeah?
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
I don't need one.
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
Hi Ma...
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
You know how to fly this thing?
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
What did you say? What did you do?
It's my wife.
Finished what?
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
Here we go again...
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
Why?... Why would you need me?
Tell me...
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
Staedert, do you read me?
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Am I disturbing you?
Welcome home.
I love you.
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
Tom...
You couldn't?
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
Anything harder?
Snuff?
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
That's five thousand dollars.
Where's that?
What are these for?
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
I figured you share information.
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
What the fuck are you.. ?
Don't ask questions.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
Keep moving.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
He's lying.
Big date tonight?
Truman Capote.
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
... Hello... ?
Where are your parents?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
Uh huh, pleasure.
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.
As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.
Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
Why do you think he did it?
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
How... how can you say that to me...?
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
I remember.  You just left...
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
No, sir, he is not.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
You alright?
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
Rick, please.
Hey, Rick!
So what's up?  What'd I miss?
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
Something the matter with the cuisine?
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
Feeling better now?
I gotta get out of here.
Excuse us, dear.
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
Who says I don't like you?
What do you mean?
But how...?
The tickets.
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
Where are we going?
Thanks for everything, Dad.
Very funny.
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
You think that's the place she's buried?
You do good work, Alice.
I thought about that.
They think I'm nuts.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
These things are wild...  What do you think?
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
What is it?
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
Reef!
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
Cyclops?
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Well?
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
What about down?
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
All ready?
Right <u>at</u> him?
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
Swell!
Why?
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
Who?
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Yes.
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
I used to play ball.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
Safety on?
Like you and Gordon?
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
I just think you used to be bad.
It's fun.
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Pop?
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Huh?
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
You? Why?
Lillian!
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
No problem. Look, I...
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
I still don't understand --
I'm sorry.
Call me.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
You've been married twice --
Alright. I'll think about it.
I know your parents.
Strange.
This is nuts.
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
It makes me sad.
Who are you?
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Take care, Wade.
It don't look right.
You talked to Jack?
The other guy.
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
Rolfe.
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
Where's Ma?
Well, it was an accident.
The night before the shooting.
Well, do you still plan to get married?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Find them everywhere. 
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
You don't want to say hi to your father?
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
Oooooh, I'm good.
Daddy...
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
It's cut.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
My husband is a very courageous man.
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
Stop.
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
I'll not going without my family.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
You know what?
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
How did your speech go?
who can I say is calling?
You wanna knock of f?
Other way around, sir.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
Kruger, Sagittarius.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
Elaine, we have to go back.
I'd use the word insane.
Are you afraid?
We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Have you got it straightened out now?
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
No.  Poached.  Over.
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
He's carrying a bomb.
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
You folks need any help?
Are you on the Mercury mission?
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
Ah, won't you sit down?
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
Both pilots!
Can't you take a guess?
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
What's his problem?
Rain.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
Hi!
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
I like my horizons narrow.
He's not here.  Why ask me?
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
Kill them both.
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
What is wrong?
What's this?  What's going on?
Nothing?
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
You know that guy?
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
... and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?"  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?
Please, I must get out here.
How potent?
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...
How do I look?
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
What?
This floor's freezing.
Can't lock up...
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
I hope you're right.  I really do.
That the atmosphere processor?
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
What's he scanning for?
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
How do you feel?
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Seventeen meters.
Let's go!  Let's go!
They're in the approach corridor.
They'll get us.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.
Locked.
Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.
It's inside the complex.
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
They cut the power.
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
Casey.  She's my only friend.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
I knew you'd come.
Are we going to sleep now?
How many colonists?
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
Where?
Did you know? Had you heard?
How was I? Tell me honestly.
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
I've come to dinnnnnner!
Where?
Why?
No! No! No!
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
No, I'm not playing this game.
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
Go back to bed.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
Alone.
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
Why you?
This is not his handwriting.
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.
Am I interrupting something?
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
I see that you're expecting.
When, may I ask?
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
Be careful!
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
A-flat, Majesty.
My pleasure.
Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Do you like this, Salieri?
Your Majesty!
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
Majesty!
Yes, where?
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
Excuse me, but how old are you?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
Well, what do you have for me today?
Why are you here?
Do you always live like this?
Pupils?
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
What's that?
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
That's right.
What?
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
What did he say? What did he say?
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
I'm sorry. No.
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.
Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
Really? Why?
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
I have come to commission work from you.
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
No, please.
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
It couldn't be simpler.
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
That will do, Herr Mozart!
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
Exactly. A dance.
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Are they?
I can't say I do. What is it?
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
Oh my son, my poor son!
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
Where?
What anger?
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
Herr Salieri.
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
How did he look?
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
Go about your duties.
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
Yes.
Yes.
Surely you're not suggesting...
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
Shall I send a car?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
Call me David.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
I was. What are you reading?
I'm twenty-seven.
Hello. You all right?
Are you better now?
My friend Jack was just here.
Bathroom.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
The next corner we can get a cab.
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
Hello, Benjamin.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
All right, you two, move along.
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
Lunatic?
There were witnesses?
You've never had bad dreams before?
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
The Slaughtered Lamb?
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
Okay.
Ask them what the candles are for.
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
Heathcliffe.
Come on, where?
It's moving.
Nice doggie. Good boy.
Jack?
Nice to see you.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
What?!
Shut up, you zombie!
It's you, David.
What are you doing here?
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
A monster. I know, I know.
Hi, Jack.
You look awful.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
I could hang myself.
Dr. Hirsch?
What here?
Hello, there. What can I get you?
What's that?
Oh.
I don't rightly know, sir.
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
Charlie!
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
What's the matter, Charlie?
I remember once when your account checked.
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
What good will that do?
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
Oh!
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
Me?
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks—
What's this?
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals—  I think I will have a drink.
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
I'm feeling fine this morning.
The theatre?
Longer.
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
Oh!
Yes?
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
Oh, make that uniform blue.
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is—
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
Of course it's true - and he knows it.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
No.
Hello, Helen!
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
What did you do with it?
Yes.
Oh now, don't be silly.
Oh, Matt . . .
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
They must have turned him down.
Did you talk to him?
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
What time did Matt Brown get in?
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
I couldn't lose him.
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
Beg pardon?
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
How?
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Beautiful.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Well?
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
Boys...
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
Can't argue that.
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
Riders --
Doc Mimms will --
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
Jesse, are you awake?
Yep.
I don't understand.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
Aw, shucks, ma'am...
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
Mmm.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Now let's have a drink.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
... too young for whisky...
There's only four of them...
Just perfect.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
The final route for the railroad is complete.
How did you know?
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
Dorsia's nice.
You like it there, don't you?
Luis is a despicable twit.
It's a plain end. I think.
Why?
That's nice.
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
Really?
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
We should do it.
Are you using minoxidil?
We need to talk.
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
But what about the past? Our past?
But where?
I think you should go now.
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
Carnes? Wait.
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
It looks so soft.
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
Dorsia.
Dorsia, yes?
I said we are totally booked.
Yes, Patrick?
Jean?
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Jean? Sorbet?
Do you have a boyfriend?
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
Forget it.
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
What...No! Put it in the carton.
Patrick? I can't hear you.
A model? An actor?
Well...
Yeah.
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Where did you go to school?
Your address?
Yeah. You know...hang out.
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Nothing.
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
He does? You're sure?
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
Is that a raincoat?
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --
It's important.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
When's Brian coming for the TV?
To our new life.  ...What's wrong?
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
They hack into people's programs?
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
I can't just walk away!
...wanna savor this.
Right. Wait. A toast.
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
What?
What?!
...When did you know?
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
Milo? I'm Danny.
We could move 'em up here.
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
You really wrote this just today?
Had you talked to him much lately?
Gary, hi.
I'm okay. It's going well!
"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."  You left my party to send E-mail?
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
What'd the girl say?
Hasn't affected his work, though.
Okay, #2.
Ready for number three?
Just thought his work should go on.
...You wanna work -- here?
You calling Phil and Randy?
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
I don't know --
Thank God.
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
Who're these guys?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
Come in.
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Oh, and Austin...
Oh, and Austin...
Thank you, Basil.
Hello, Exposition.
My God, Austin, what have you done?
All right, Austin, I think you should go.
Be careful.
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
My wedding tackle.
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
I can't see a bloody thing.
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
You're smashed, Vanessa.
Not in the Nineties.
Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
I'll hurry back.
Austin, what's your point?
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
Don't mind if I do.
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
Oh my God, he's back.
But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
Ow! You shot me!
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
How's Austin?
You didn't...
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
Really?
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
Hope...
Would that I could say the Same.
I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
Quite a collection.
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
People, too.
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
How curious ...
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
You know, I believe she's actually jealous.
The result would be ...
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
Choices?
I was about to throw in the towel.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
Much better.
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
For you, Mrs. Peel.
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
Where am I?
Yes ... ?
You're playing games.
No, after you.
Aren't you coming?
What's that you're wearing?
What is it?
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
Mrs. Peel?
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
Makes two of us.
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
Privately owned by ...
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
Amnesia?
You with Mother or Father?
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
That's what we're going to find out...
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
What?
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
All right!
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Seventy-five hundred.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
Rick, I want to talk to you.
I don't want any trouble.
I love that car.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
This is it, lady. Last stop.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
Are you okay?
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
A strange wang right in my palm.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
Hookers beat you up?
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
You've been having strange sex...!
Mrs.?
Who was that?
Hey, you guys...
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
What are you going to do about it?
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
You know Knowlton pretty well?
-- Knock it off!
...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
You gotta let me finish --
It doesn't go like that.
People actually used to pay you for this?
Ready?
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
-- What were they doing there?
Anything else?
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
Brian.
Huh.
I work for city hall.
With grenadine, right?
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
Oh Jesus Christ...
I need another one, sir.
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
I don't guess.
Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
Your brother was a good man.
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
Mr. McCaffrey...
So, you surviving without me?
Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.
Who's going to die?
Fireman shit?
Firehouse.
He just wants to --
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
You can't talk about my brother like that...
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
Didn't think you'd make it.
It knows us. This one knows us.
Alderman Swayzak.
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
People.
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I want 15 on the Mets.
Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money.
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.
He gots to be did.
And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
Seconds and thirds, too.
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
What's wrong with him?
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
I'm out.
You can walk away.  We both can.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
But the line has to be drawn.
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
Negroes would be in an uproar.
We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
This has to be a big mistake.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
That's what I'm askin'.
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
Manray!
Sounds risky to me.
Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
Same here.
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
Is that good or bad?
Why'd you do that?
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Yes he did.
No.
You know how your Daddy is.
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
How did you get this gig?
The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em.
Yes you!
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
...yes she did.
I don't know who I am.
So what's up with you?
This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
You're sure this is a good idea.
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
How did you get this gig?
You leave something out?
And?
Aw, c'mon.
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
O'Grady.
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
I have no luggage.
Who else can give me information about you?
The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?
Not one.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
I feel the ribbon.
Why are you shaking?
But you refused me, Dorothy.
As much as possible?
Does this assignment interest you?
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
May I be quite frank with you?
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?
Dark Valdez.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
He is only curious to know who you are.
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
I don't know... I like the Army.
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
And he'd been shot.
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --
He -- He made me do it --
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
Where?
Back up.
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
Right?
His chest was hamburger --
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
What happened to "degrees"?
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
Is it the truth?
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Something funny, Levi?
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
How do you know?
MAYBE WHAT --
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
Nevertheless --
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
That was kid gloves?
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
What?
I pushed him too hard.
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
What?
This isn't the time --
You're a good man, Hardy.
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Nah.
I don't think I want to hear this --
Maybe we shouldn't go.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
We just want --
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
Pike never confessed.
Enjoy your flight to Washington --
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
Tell him to shut up --
Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
This is totally unnecessary --
He's not Army, it's not official --
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
You think he did it?
You want Kendall, don't you?
What happens to Dunbar now?
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
Bloom like a flower?
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
Or are you too scared?
How would you describe him?
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
You owe me three-fifty.
When did you ever work in an office?
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
Let's get out of here.
I'm sorry.
Daffodils?
How can I convince you to stop?
Wait! I need those!
I can't imagine any place better than here.
It's me. Norther Winslow.
Oh. Oh.
How did you know my father?
Were you and my father having an affair?
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
I'm going with you.
I talked with your father last night.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
Do you love your father?
I need you on my side.
How did you get here?
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
How is he?
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
Did you and Dad have any other property?
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
Yeah it was okay.
The sets were good.
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
Say thank you.
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
No.
You must have a visa or something...
Tell me what he said.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
He wants a lot of money.
Oh Jesus.
So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
I don't understand.
Syevodnya?
They go. John. They go.
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
I don't want to know.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
So uh...
Oh Jesus.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
No.
And? What are you saying?
And who says what is wrong.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Sometimes which?
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
I got what I paid for.
Excuse me?
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
She's alive!! She is not dead?
Okay. Goodbye.
It's not mine.
Why?
My name's Sophia.
How do you want to pay?
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
Is your niece older than 12?
More cough syrup?
I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'...
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
Still need a lift?
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
Better?
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
YOU SHUT UP!
Or what? OR WHAT?
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
Like a man.
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
Let me say somethin' first...
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
You take it straight?
Want another?
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
What is it?
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
Sorry.
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.
You need some weed?
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
Goin' dove huntin'?
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
Heard about this morning.
Keep the change on that.
Thank you.
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
I just wanted some make-up.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great.
Back-up.
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
Squid?
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
I've continued working on the case!
Nick...
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.
What's in the box?
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
How many men?
Thank you.  You have one?
Louder, pal, louder.
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.
Don't be an ass.
I don't remember saying yes.
They want your autograph.
I still think you're a bastard.
I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.
This is my stop.
How big a package we talking about?
One guy do all the damage?
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.
Why tell me this?
With these?
If I say no?
Good.
He knows what he's doing.
Let's go while there is still time.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
Would you like to be modified?
The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.
What, Sebastian?
Show me something?
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
What was he after?
She was gonna get away.
I didn't like her.
Yeah.
Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South.
Vodka!
Thank you very much.
Prosit.
I like you.
How old am I?
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
What's that?
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
During the road test...
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
You sure?
Why didn't you go?
Taffey Lewis?
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
Who?
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
Jeezus!
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
I'd take him to the doctor.
Why not?
Is there anything else?
I've already got more help than I need.
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
This feels stupid.
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
Thanks.
Well?
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
My office.
Well, that depends...
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
Dickhead?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
So far?
It was amazing.
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
Why are you doing that?
I guess we'll need another locker.
Thank you.
Because I want to get married.
One who's not a mutant.
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
Now, get out!!
Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
Hey, Eve!
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
I certainly do!
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
What?
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
I don't blame you!
Uh-huh. Adam?
No.
A card?
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Oh, boy! A jacket!
C'est bon, Monsieur.
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
But, I don't understand.
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
Uh-huh.
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
Right on the button.
When did we get it from them?
It's so small.
No.
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
Yes. He likes windows.
Why not? He has great pants.
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
How old are you?
Help you?
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
Dad!
Yes?
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
What's that noise?
You have tranquilizers?
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Why?
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
Yes.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
What are you bitching about now?
So where is your roommate, the model?
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
I don't know.
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Frank. Come in.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.
Jeffrey?
What color is it?
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Okay?
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
THEN WHAT?
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Do you like that?
Do you like the way I feel?
You can hit me, if you want to.
Do you like me?
Hi, can I come in?
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
Oh shit.
Look.
No. I should go.
You what?
There's no disease, I can tell you.
You called me Jeffrey.
I guess I should go.
What?
Oh no.
Frank gone?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
Frank?
Can I feel 'em?
Hello?
Hey? You like to walk.
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Can I use the car tonight?
God, you scared me.
Nothing. I'm fine.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
How ya doin' Dad?
Oh yeah?
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
I guess I'll see you sometime.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
You really want to do this, don't you?
What's the plan.
Brilliant.
That sounds good.
Here's to. An interesting experience.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
What's with Mike?
Yeah?
Shoot.
Jeffrey!!
Okay.
What was that all about?
You want to dance?
My father has a gun at home.
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Jeffrey? What's going on?
I should go with her, Sandy.
Hey, I just...
Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.
Chest pocket.  Shit!
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
What?
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
What the fuck are you doing?
Look again for fuck sake!
Shit.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
You guys?
Mother, is that you?
What?! What are you doin'?
Yeah, we promise.
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
Would someone please come over here and...
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
Nervous?
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
Give the guy a shot.
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
What?
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
The what man?
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time.
How many bodies, Greenly?
After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?
Oh my god!
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
Promise me boys.
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
Hello?
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
Yes.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Forgive me father.
Father, I'll do you right here.
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.
What color hair does he have?
This is he?
Where are you going?
Loop around real fast.
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
There's another stocker, right?
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
Can I get that credit card from you?
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
Which one was that?
He needs to hire an attorney.
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
Why don't you come with us.
I wish I'd been there.
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
Sixteen dollars.
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
When'd you get back?
You could give somebody a concussion.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
What's happening? What's going on?
Wait for Kumar.
You're kidding.
Come on.
What?
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
You got to be kidding me.
You think Applejack knew?
Why?
How big is it?
What's he in for?
You mean like techniques?
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
Congratulations. You passed the test.
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
No, that door over there.
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
See you.
You think he got my license plates?
Bob, where you going?
Why not?
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
Where'd they come from?
Wait. Did he see us?
You don't celebrate til it's over.
What?
They are.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
What did I say?
The guy is fucking insane.
Where'd she go?
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
What are you doing?
This is natural.
Did we get it?
You really think he'll remember you?
Bob. Are you coming?
The weed.
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
This could be a trap.
I know it's not.
Dignan.
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
Come on in. What you been up to?
Everything OK?
Do you have your own room?
Do you have your own cell?
Do they let you --
Hold on --
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
I might have mentioned it.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
How you doing, Bob?
Is he good?
He left his sweater.
Where is he? Where is Rob?
You a good pool player.
How's the weather down there?
Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.
Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
That's not gonna fly.
I want to know what happened.
May I finish?
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
She say what time I should call?
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
I emptied it.
You still should've moved.
Who sent you to Greece?
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
I'll get the book.
Sleep. Sleep now.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
No... How?
Where --
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
-- where's left to go? --
Switch! You drive!
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I know it's a dream.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
My first job.
No... Jason... please...
It's me.
Okay, Jason, your move.
Don't need it. I remember everything.
You didn't answer my question.
Looks like he's been detained.
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
-- go -- take the van! --
Alright... take it down.
Show me.
What kind of problems?
Amnesia?
Believed what?
Let's give him half an hour.
Anything?
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
Yes. In that order.
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
He won't come.
Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.
What is it?!
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
Stephen ready?
Wanna stay with me tonight?
You'll move
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
Thank you for accepting.
I've missed you.
Tonight then.
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
No dances, just tell me.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
All the dads are gonna be there.
No.
Please, mom. People will talk.
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Dad lives here?
Where are you now?
Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
Books?
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
Get out. Both of you.
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
Not since we were kids.
So how's Tommy?
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
Are you okay?
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
What's happened to you?
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Then you think it might have worked out?
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
Listen to me good, Evan...
Meant no offense.
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
Shut up, Tommy!
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
Yes, I'll bet.
You want my advice?
Go back to Bulgaria.
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
Here you are.
Here's to you, sir.
Er, goodbye, sir.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
Please.
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
I don't know the finish yet.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
Put them on the table.
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
Hello, Sam.
It's been a long time.
When will he be back?
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
No, Victor, there isn't.
Be careful.
Hello, Rick.
How do you do?
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
You will give us the names?
For the time being.
What else, my dear Major?
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
It was a combination of all three.
I was misinformed.
You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
Is that a serious offer?
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
Where were you last night?
Give me another.
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
Are my eyes really brown?
Get me the Radio Tower!
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
Boss, let's get out of here.
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
Get up.
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
Do too little you'll die.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.
What are you doing?
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
Oh?  You've tried?
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
No.  that was the last one.
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
Merry Christmas eve.
Four four.  A record.
Hey, look at you.
This isn't working out.
No.
That's your dog.
There isn't any us.
I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
Her name's Hannah.
What's that?
There was a coffin?
Come on.  Try.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
This is so unfair.
I love you, Chuck.
But chickens?
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
The place is falling apart.
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
You what?
You fucked us over.
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
Forget it.
You are one sick fucker.
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
How about we go somewhere else?
Cool ropes.
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
That's what it's about.
What, then?
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
Only if you can afford it.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
And that I can drive a truck!
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
Is your family in the apple business, too?
People watched the movies in their cars?
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
What's the *medical* explanation?
But you had so much *responsibility*.
I *know* this was right.
*What* will be okay?
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
You don't understand! It's her father...
Stop it! Just cut it out!
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
That's true.
So here is my candidate. What do you think?
I just wanted to ask you...
What's an immigrant?
Uh... it's the end of October.
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
At what altitude?
Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. We didn't write them. I don't see no reason to read them.
I'm stayin', Homer.
If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her.
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
I thought it was my turn.
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
You okay, Rose?
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
That's *it*?
Who cares?
Do you know him?
They told me I was too old to serve.
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!
You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
Silicon Valley?
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
This has to happen fast.
It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.
The Anti-Christ?
Your life flashing before your eyes?
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
She had you tempting fate.
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
The red hair... It's bad luck.
Moonan. Here. Shit...
Shit.
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.
When?
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens...
I guess it lacks a certain style.
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
Why?
How much?
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake.
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
Sorry, I --
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
What about Customs?
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
And some new clothes.
I don't trust anyone.
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
Look at you... You want to go.
Do you have something to prove?
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
How do you deal with --
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?
What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?
It's bad luck.
You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?
What do we do? We change the scam?
No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!
I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.
King ain't gonna like this.
Stand up.
What?
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
Good... I gotta go.  So, what do you have for me?
I'm Bella.
You're shaking.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.
I get it.
Good night?
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
I couldn't resist them.
I want to hear it.
What's the time?
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
You're entitled to your opinion.
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
Nothing about you.
No.
So how are you doing, dad?
I've lived there.
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
Do you believe in astrology?
He doesn't gamble.
What happened?
I didn't.
I'm in trouble.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.
I'm sorry.
Is it yes?
Yes.
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
She's my baby.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
And the girls?
Don't worry, I won't report you!
What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
She's not in the gaming business is she?
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
What's he doin'?
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
It didn't go off.
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
The only thing which exists is myself.
Snap out of it, bomb.
Exactly.
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
Yes.
In a second.
New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
-- automatic channels open --
You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
What happened, Doolittle?
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
Commander? Are you still there?
We're running out of time, sir.
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
Who's Camille?
Move it.
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
Same old story.  Not interested.
I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
Damn... Are you alright?
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
What makes you cry?
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
Who is...
Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
You got a lotta nerve.
Bent.
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
What's in it for you?
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
I'm sorry.
Well, not me personally.
You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
Who is it?
How do I know you're telling the truth?
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
As long as you're okay.
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
A little what?
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
A long time.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
She's got my word.
Probably a touch of what's going around.
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
A toy?
So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
She was the one--
True, but--
That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
For a change.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
What the hell is that?
Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
What's that?
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
Sorry.
Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.
What was that D.J.'s name again?
...at twenty-thirty hours.
Any luck?
That's Sherry VanHafton.
Whoa... she just farted.
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
What the fuck!
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
No... You don't think...?
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
Wait! I know how we can get in!
Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.
Well? Continue! Continue!
Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
Oh, yeah! You and what army?
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
Good morning, mongrels!
Are you AFRAID?
What happened?
What was his name?
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
Beg pardon?
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
So... you just moved here?
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
Donnie?
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
Well...
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
Is that a cellar door?
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
People aren't that simple.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
Grandma Death.
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
Cellar door.
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
His name is Frank.
What is her name?
How many times have you seen Frank?
Can anyone else see him?
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
How does that make you feel?
Is Callie still around?
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
Yes. I went to jail.
I think now that he might...
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
How is that possible?
What is going to happen?
I can see him right now!
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
No I don't.  She worries about you.
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Our son just called me a bitch.
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
Is Mom okay?
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
Loretta, don't do that.
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.
Mrs. Leeman?
Oh shit!
Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies.
I hate her!
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
Here, I'll take it. It's my job.
Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant!  If you are -- come back, sweetie. Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU!
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
The bitch.
...You betcha. S'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...
That's enough!
Oh! What is it?
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!
Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
Of course you're All aware a king must have an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me where I'd ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong
Go out and chase that peanut vendor away from the building -- Get rid of him if you have to use violence - if necessary call out the militia and if he isn't looking get me a bag of peanuts.
In case of fire, how long will it take to empty this place?
In her dressing room?  Why, what could he be doing there?
Well - what is he now?
What do you whistle?
Oh no, I can't do it.
What other job you got?
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
My card.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
Are you getting tired?
When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --
That's what you think.
Give me that again!
Then it's war?
What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?
Your Excellency!
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
So that's the one you want to marry.
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
They have noble faces.
You won't be long?
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
You stay with me.
You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!
What are you going to do?
What happened?
I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
I want him back!
Good morning, Treves.
Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.
A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
Have you read it?
John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.
Of course! You want out?
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
Thank you very much.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
Yyess.
Mmmerrick.
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness...
John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.
...Yes potatoes... but...
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
Who are they of?
...my... home?
Is it the one you wanted?
No, John, not one that I can see.
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
Won't come out, eh?
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
A dressing bag?
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
Pardon me?
Open up! I know you're in there!
Right! Where is he?
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
Well... where is he?
It's your fantasy...
Those things in your hands.
WHY?
No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
What was she like?
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
No!
But --
How do we know this is the way?
But you don't want to hear it.
We're just not a very musical nation...
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
Looting and pillaging, eh?
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
About NOT raping you...
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
How deep IS the ocean?
Who have you been talking to?
It's always the women that start the trouble.
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
Row!
No! Let go, Snorri!
There is another way.
Well, what else do we do?
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
I AM one, Dad!
Sven!
It can't do you any HARM...
Vanish into thin air?
You know, my son, our lord said...
Well! Come on!
Who's that?
What?
Get away, Snorri.
You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
My brother blacksmiths!
Wasn't it, Keitel?
Help!
KILL! KILL!
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
And something to sharpen them with?
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.
Who was the girl you walked off with?
Shit. The last time I saw you.
No, it was lovely.
Come over after I'm done here?
I'm so excited. Yay!
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
I don't have one.
I like it.
I can't remember.
I'm sure you would.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
Huckleberry Hound?
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
It's okay.
Take care.
You like that?
Well, I should probably get going.
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
Yeah.
I don't think we're ready.
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
Oh, thank God. It's going.
I want to know you.
Joely...
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
Right. Something black though.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
Probably.
I know.
You said...
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
Male or female?
Have sex. Y'know --
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
Yeah?
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
Hi, it's Joel.
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
You must have been crazy.
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
She's so sexy.
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
Okay. I wish you could come.
Clementine.
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
Stan... c'mon...
See you later, alligator.
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
I really like you, Mary. You know that.
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
We can't do this.
What, Howard?
Stan? What's going on?
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
Well, where was Patrick?
So, I've got to drop the van off.
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
Oh, hi.
The voltage looks fine.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.
I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
You don't?
A traveler, eh?
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
No, I guess not.
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
I'm cold.
Thanks.
So now you're bummin' around?
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?
You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.
Time to play Spam in the can.
The containment, Second Containment...
What?
I don't know what happened to Justin.
Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...
Please...
Please... kill...
What's happening...?
Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.
You're not seriously considering sending him?
Does he know that?
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
Peters is right, no one's here.
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
I found one.
Can anybody hear me...
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
Explanation?
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
Where has it been for the past seven years?
We're leaving.
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
Weir is dead.
We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
What?
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
Claire...
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were... 
He's engaged the override.
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
We have to do something, oh God...
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing... 
Miller, do you read me, Peters --
A straight line.
That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
Those yours too?
I mean...
I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
About me? How sweet.
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
I'll be watching over you.
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
I had it at four.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
How long was I out?
What the --!
We had a tough year.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Hey! That's a prototype!
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
Back it down, Johnny!
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
You're really cramping my style here.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
They're ready for you, sir.
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
How's the IPO?
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Front page?
For science.
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
What are you doing?
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
I can... make it work.
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Not until Ben is back inside!
Ben did this?
Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
What's going on?
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
Please don't make this personal --
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
I can't find it, mon!
Easy, mon.
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?
Mom says to clean up the pool.
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
I don't know. I was just curious.
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Jeff you have company!
Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
You're a really good kisser.
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
Hey, Mike?
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.
Mark. What happened to your date?
Did you go home and get it?
Poor guy.
Jesus. I'm sorry.
You're losing it, Damone.
The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
How've you been?
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
Who's that?
Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
Just kidding. About 10cc.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
Does that ever happen?
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
Where do you feel like going?
That's a nice shirt.
It's very warm out tonight.
I think I better take you home.
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
John Bonham?
Hi, Mark.
Anything to drink?
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Let's have lunch!
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
What's the message? My light is blinking.
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
Rum and ice, please.
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
What are you talking about?
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
I have to go.
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
Where'd you get that knife?
What limes?
You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
What tape?
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
You degenerate pig!
Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.
Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.
Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
I know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me. He's one of these Satanism freaks. He offered me human blood -- said it would take me higher than I've ever been in my life.  I thought he was kidding, so I told him I'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome -- or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on.
Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
So do we, lady.
I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame!
Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.
You'd pay me for that?
May I see your license.
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
We'll meet in three hours?
Where are you two going?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
I don't think you should...
We shot a skunk.
Oh!
You all sure about this?
Scared?
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
What now, Geronimo?
Why do you take shit from him?
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
Will I go crazy or something?
Doesn't your foot hurt?
My husband...
Will these boards hold?
What's it for!?
Is it gassed up?
Open?
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
I wouldn't do that, son.
Welcome back.
They were all over the place.
Blow the goddamn hatch!
Fine, Chief.
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
Hey!
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
DON'T!
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
Let's go!
Go! Go!
Oh my God... What is that?
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
Did we make it?
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.
Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
You know what I mean.
That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
You're afraid!
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
Madam...?
...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.  The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.
What's up?
A rich actress.
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
...Don't you?
This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
It's already started, Dad... with me.
Of course.
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
Bread?
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
Oh, Kurt!
Only if you were in it. Are you?
Why... yes.
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
How'd I look?
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
Jesus.
Harry... I met someone.
Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
Don't start, Farmer.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
What for?
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
Take a walk, pal.
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
There's just one more thing.
It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.
I love you, Harry. I love you.
Where to?
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
Where you goin'?
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Yeah.
Did you expect him to look you up?
You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
What?
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
'But how do I know you love me?'
Mama...
I don't care.
It's okay.
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
What?
How long will you be?
I'm back, Mama.
Don't... talk crazy.
Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
Oh! Are you really?
Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
This whole thing is a joke!
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
Why?
You're an outcast.
I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
Friend?
Soon?
You will honor your promise to me!
Must've been a terrible row.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
He always was opinionated.
Have you seen Willie?
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
God took her from us.
This feels... incestuous.
I wish to be your wife.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
What sort of task?
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
For what?
What happened up there?
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
Paracelsus?
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
I heard.
He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God...
It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
Good night, Alice.
Any particular reason?
I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
You think you're gonna last all summer?
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
Help you clean up?
What is it?
Roll him over!
You just had some lucky shots.
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
Ha!
Jack?
How about our last jay?
Looks like a storm.
It's just a dream.
Are you wet?
It's beautiful...
Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
Have to drop you here, Steve.
Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?
We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --
Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.
You don't believe in suicide.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
Not a chance.
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
Yes.
She's dead?
Was? As in not anymore?
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
Why are you so agitated?
What are you going to do?
You too, preacher?
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
That happens, you'll get it back.
I promise.
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
What?
Do what?
What did I say?
Creepy guy.
Yeah.
Should I use the last bullets on us?
-- you got your sink --
-- see this, television!
Hot goddamn day!
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
Best in Mexico.
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
Did you even to try to negotiate?
Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
I don't know, you just passed out.
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
You know what you look like?
How?
He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.
They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
Got it.
Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT?
No, sir, WHAT?
Ah, c'mon...
Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
Hardly the case, Senator.
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
Uh, question, ma'am.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
You know him.
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
Close as I can get, el-tee!
Chances of recovery?
Unless you Whiskey Run.
So dump on me.
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
No shortage of suspects.
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
"In Washington..."
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
I can't go out.  Not like this.
Do you, uh, know...
So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?
Permission to get dressed, sir?
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact.
Would you have shot if it was a man?
Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.
O'Neil...
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
You don't suppose this is just part of...
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
I like that image.
That why you dumped him?
Don't you think we have enough?
He's not going to do it.
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
I'll take them all.
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
You never said it was off the record.
What are you doing here?
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
My life sucks.
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
Your old sweetheart?
Wish me luck!
Can I use some?
I can't.
We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
Really? A girlfriend then?
Hence the radiation.
Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
And how should we do that, Sir?
That is our job.
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
It's the French Secret Service.
How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.
Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
You WILL go out there.
What?  What?
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
May I get the check?
WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
I don't know.
You said "the Commander.
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
Brandon.
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
... What does that mean?
No, I'll kill you. .
We've got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone...
Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
They're still behind us...
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
Your last name.
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
We're alive!
This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
It's Jason...
Hey... Hey where are you going?
There's nobody here. Jason...
All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
How does the rolling help, actually?
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
You're kidding. When for?
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
Weapons storage...
Then how did he find out about the device?
Former Commander?
I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
Could be this.
Anything.
Okay... On what?
enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are
WHAT? WH
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
Have you heard?  The British are negotiating to make a trade for General Lee.
These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see.
What?  What are you talking about?
Me?  You apologizing to me?
Wil...
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
Who is that!?
I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.
I'm so inclined.
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
Yessir.
George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation.
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
They are... friends of Congress.
Washington is perfect.  He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!
Makes you gag.
Oh, come now...
Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.
What do you mean you're not a Christian?  Of course you're a Christian, we're all Christians...
Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold.
Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette...
No, please; an advance on your salary.
My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!
Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you!  They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you!  Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.
"Liberty, Virtue, Country"... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans?  As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days...
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
Martha... what?
Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
What the hell are we doing?
Well, this must be about something!
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
You're out of your mind!
You are a slave owner!  You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley!  That land belongs to the natives!
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?
For God sake, get that horrid stuff off your face.  You look like a damned slave!  It's damned humiliating.
You're kidding me, right?
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
And that's for the airport.
About sixty.
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
She's... young.
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
You know how to write one of these?
That's all there is to it, huh?
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
In just a second. Two...
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people –-
C-18.
Hello? You there?
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
You're an investor, is that it?
Something shouldn't be there.
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
That's what I'm doing.
A marker's like a check, Harry.
You're not looking at me, Harry.
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
Ever shot anybody.
Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
Yeah. That was a good party.
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
At that point, basically, that has to be it.
Very nice...
How? By taking my money?
But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
Rough day on the set?
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
You saw that one?
I got you a copy of the script.
Then you've read it?
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
Harry... My God...
Why not?
You sure?
You okay?
I miss Murray, Harry.
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
I don't have a dog.
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over.
You think the extra strain caused it?
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
Maureen.
Roger.
Last thing we want is extra partners.
This's gonna hurt a little.
Try Wednesday.
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.
If you get it back in one piece.
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
I thought you said it was just a blade.
How much longer's that gonna take?
How long?
Obviously it's some kind of screw up. The shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate.
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
That'd be my guess.
On a passenger ship in 1953?
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
Yeah.
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
You're late.
Don't fall asleep.
What's slow?
Morning everybody.
Any dizziness?
You okay?
What'd you find up there?
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
The ah... the radio's out.
Smashed it up pretty bad.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Couldn't sleep.
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
What, like some kind of ghost?
What happened?
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
Too deep to anchor out there.
Call the Coastguard?
Morning.
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
Never been more thirsty in my life.
What happened?
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
Guess.
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
Are you still looking for a job?
What?
About what?
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
Who is this, Enid?
I...
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
That guy rules!
Yeah, right.
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
I just stopped in to say hi.
What do you mean "why"?
Yeah, right...
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
Okay... I promise.
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
What? Why?
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
Why?
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
So what should we do?
Look, that's back when I hated you.
What does it stand for?
What's going on now? What's he doing?
Are you sure?
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
This is way too creepy.
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
Ew, look at this...
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
What? How long have you been standing there?
Why are we going here? I hate this place.
Ew ... when did you get that?
You won't believe it! Guess!
Just now... I went with Seymour.
But those are our people...
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
You're gross.  See that guy?
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
Do you want to do something tonight?
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
What happened to Seymour?
How repulsive!
When was this?
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
Do you want anything?
Wow... finally.
I'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and I'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. I'm so excited to finally have some free time. We have to get together this summer!
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
You still interested in that?
Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.
Didn't they tell you?
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
Hi... what's your name?
...are you waiting for a bus?
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
Do you have any old Indian records?
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
What about her? Would you go out with her?
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Yes, that would certainly do...
What did you tell that girl?
Jesus...
It's not hopeless...
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
You can open your eyes now.
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
Never...
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
Oh, hi...
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
Boo!
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
Just someone so young...
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
Where did you get this?
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records?  She could at least have the decency to call me back.
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
What do we have here, Margaret?
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Why would she be hiding from me?
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
Thank you, doctor.
-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-
Morning, friend, glorious day.
I am a man of peace.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.
I couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." As if it were the most normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."
I don't suppose I could watch.
How lucky we are.
All right- thee second embankment will go there. 
Second death? Where?-
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?
It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.
For you.
Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once.
How many cattle?
Why so many?
Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
Everybody has a choice.
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
So this is what you do, huh?
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
Are you all squeaky clean now?
Does she know anything about babies?
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
I'm not even good for me.
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
Yes, I did.  We were city champs.
So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
Egon!
That's it?  "I'll be back?"
I'm Egon --
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
Is the line sinking?
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
What kind of tests?
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
Tell him about the toaster.
How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?
Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
You're the best one in your row.
You must have gotten the last copy.
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
All right.  Since you put it that way.
Do you want this body?
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
Did you see it?  What was it?
I want you to have this. 
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
Oh!  You're here.
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Something was definitely here.
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
All right.  I'll try.
Where's the Keymaster?
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
You talked to Gozer?
I've got to sleep.
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
Anything!  Just make contact.
You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.
This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
Wow!  Does this pole still work?
They will.
As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension.
Agile bastard, isn't he?
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
Me, too.
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
That's what you told me two days ago!
More wine, sister?  Surely you can drink more than that.
They hate me, they really hate me don't they?
It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
How about in the forum.  Right in front of the Senate.
Tribuus... tomorrow.
What is that... wailing?
Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
Then you'd be out of a job.
Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
So am I.
Take grain away from the army?
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
The Senate too?
Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?
You know our two most senior Senators:  Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
"If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
Servis made it through again?
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
As soon as I can.
What about their philosophy lessons?
This is our oil from our estates?
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
Death is a very light thing for you.
It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.
Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you take a fall.
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
Do you want some dinner?
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
We won't. Let's go inside.
Was she married or something?
I do.
What's the matter?
You mean the one who --
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
-- really incredible --
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
I said I think it is.
Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
The marble?
Are you going home?
Is that so? You might marry me?
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
Why do you have to see him?
Oh no. He said that.
657-2036
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
What are you then?
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
Well here's the purse.
Where are you?
Give me an hour.
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
I'll have a porter show you the room.
Whatever it is you're upset about.
All right then.
Please wait till my husband gets home.
Drink?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
What do you think?
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Yes?
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
Thank you.
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
What?
Don't be nervous.
I want to say something first.
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
Hello, Benjamin.
May I sit down?
He didn't see me.
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Yes.
I got a single room.
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Yes?
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
You're not interested in art?
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
Him?
We're talking.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
Why did you do that?
Well I can't.
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
What was your major?
Really. I want to know.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
No.
Do you understand that?
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
What are you doing?
But it's not.
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Nothing else.
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
Well --
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
What?
Sir?
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
Hello.
Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
You miss the point.
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
Can you see me now?
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life.
Have you a minute now?
And what are you going to do?
Need any help?
No --
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
I have an idea working in my head... 
We'll dance.
That was lovely.
I'll do anything for you.
Yes -- I'd love to.
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
And -- and --
Go away. Who are you --?
The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
Why do you smile?
What can you see?
No.
That's a silly joke.
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance.
It's always so quiet here.
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
Telegrams?
Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh, the pain.
You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
I'm engaged for the evening.
No - absinthe.
You like music?
Dance then? 
You must look at my face and not at the floor.
You're trembling.
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
Am I!
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
Tired?
What is this?
You...
Skiing? 
No.
How nice -- your daughters?
Miss Flaemm.
I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel.
I must go to England -- at once.
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
What we want to know about is Manchester.
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
No water -- What a place!
Sorry, Preysing. 
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
Take them back, Suzette.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
Good morning, Pimenov.
Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.
Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
Yes, I know them --
I know -- I know.
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
You wanna talk to me straight up?
Motherhood.
You're calling the shots.
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
He's a good kid. A salesman.
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
Yes, yes, but that's --
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
What's up?
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track.
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out.
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
You ought to put a bandage on that.
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
I just came back from Phoenix.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
Just a few bucks.
What?
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
I can't. I just left home.
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
Roy? It this all we have?
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
Her job.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
Atascadero.
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever.
What is it? What's going on?
What's that?
You watch that mouth.
I realize this is a shock.
Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
I can be real stiff.
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
Besides, it's historically inaccurate.
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
No.  Wait for the police.
I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be able to live wherever I want.
Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
Why didn't you tell me?
He found you, didn't he?
Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate.
I can see that.  Why?
You really think Eddie killed her?
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
Let the party begin.
He do that to you?
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
You've been watching too much TV.
Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
My, God!  What have you done to him?
It was there when I found him this morning.  It looks like some kind of letter or number or --
What now?!
Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
No.
Um.
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
I didn't tell you everything.
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
What'll you do for transportation?
I'm liable to find anything!
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
How short the skirts are.
I've been looking at motorcycles.
Otherwise, how are things?
I dunno, boy.
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
Go to the funeral?
I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
Me?
Okay.  Okay.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
Is Penelope in?
It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
What went wrong?
You're my buddy.
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
Excellent!
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Why don't you go to bed--son.
Play?
Dad--
What kind of exercise?
Like hugging a lamp post.
What's that all about?
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Breakfast?
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
Let me guess--breakfast is served?
What then?
That's what you're supposed to say.
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
You learned this in some college course?
And he keeps it in his apartment?
I came for Paul as well.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
Two hundred years old.
Things.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
You're begging him to kill you?
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
Honor, I suppose.
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
I feel the same way.  What next?
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
It died for your sins.
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
Don't shoot.
No.
New lives begin!
Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows?
Won't you please join our club? Please?
Because he was cruel?
Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
Kid--kid--
What's this?
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
A what kind of doctor?
Not true.
A lot of people don't.
I hate that thing.
Mom?
What are his symptoms?
Really?
Yeah.
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
I see.
We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
Possibly.
We made the date three months ago.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
This is very good for us.
They didn't murder me.
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
You fool, you fool.
You've got to fight from time to time.
Phooey.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
What we offer here is nude body to body contact on a bed in a private room. It's twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars an hour. Anything else you desire may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tips are allowed. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
No.
I just want to ask some questions.
There's a girl I want to ask you about.
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
That's cool.
I'm getting angry.
I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
The other girl is the star?
No.
Nah.
Where is she?
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
No.
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
You're not a private detective either, are you?
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
Jesus.
You won't keep growing at this rate.
Say what?
Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.
No.
I don't see why I must justify myself to you. I don't care about the things you do. I don't care what's happening in New York or Los Angeles. I don't care about movies or TV. I don't care who's on Johnny Carson.
What does that mean?  What does he do?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.
I can stop if you want.
I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
Yeah.  Well, mostly.
Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
No, I didn't think she was. Let me get the picture here. Let me guess. She was an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she didn't fuck around...
I don't know.
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
They're legal now.
Where is she?
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
The police? They know less than you do.
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
What happened?
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
I hear you got money to spend.  I hear you're interested in... interesting things.
You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
Where's Ratan?
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
I'm off that case. He fired me.
I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
You can fuck off, too.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
Jake'll take care of me.
I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.
You are at the University, Candy?
And what are you studying?
Eh, Poli Sci?
Isn't this your vehicle?
Lady, let me get this straight.
Okay, lady. Out.
This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
And what do you do, my dear?
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
But this is my car.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
Sort of.
Harold?
Do you often model for Glaucus?
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
You look as if you could.
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
Why not?
No.
I think he's following us.
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
The ice is melting.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
But they have.
But they'll put me in jail.
Don't you advance on me.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
- end where I began.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
Supper for two.
"And this too shall pass away."
Mother.
I'm going to marry the woman I love.
Yes. It does.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
And a lot of time.
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
None at all?
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
Your studies?
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
Why?
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
Yes.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
He... he loved me.
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
It's a beautiful dress...
I want to go back!
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
No bad dreams.
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
What?
What do you mean?
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
Get out of the way.
Nonsense, I...
Where am I?
What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
He talked about Demons, huh?
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
Nah -- he's taken care of.
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
What the hell was that? An ape?
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
Don't look! Turn around.
How does he know so much about me?
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
What are you trying to say?
You're kidding --
Whatcha looking at, John??
What are you, a Boy Scout?
You want me to hold him down?
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
Strong.
But it's not true, is it?
Pardon?
What's happening?
Oh.
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
Many times.
We want the man who did this --
Please listen to me --
You were holding onto it like grim death.
No.
You bastard --
I'm brother Frank.
Well?
I'm hurting
-- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
Well?
Later.
A long time.
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
Kirsty.
Sure.
What's the problem?
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
How long since you were here?
All right.
No argument.
Larry!
Where are you?
What have you done?
Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
Are you all right?
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
What are you talking about?
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
Is this your place ?
Oh Christ.
Who brought me in here?
What a pretty tune.
I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
What did you say?
Well I want you to see the house.
Take care, Dad.
Are you O.K.?
I guess.
I won't be able to stand.
I'm here.
What do we do if there isn't?
I see.
Oh!
Can I lend you a hand?
What did I say?
I'll come back later, huh?
Do I know you?
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
What did he ever do to you?
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
The band that found me and asked me to join.
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
None.  Christ!
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
What's up?
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
Well what about the new Echo --
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
That's what I said.
A couple blocks!  About six!
Who are you going to see?
Don't do it, Rob!
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Great.
Laura?  Are you okay?
I dunno.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Shit!
Are you coming home?
Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
But don't you remember?
You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it.  You said -- and I quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."
What's the obvious stuff?
What?
I suppose so.
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
I told you I slept with him.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?
Will you call me?
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
Hello.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
I'm sure.
You know I'm a good person.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
Sure they are.
Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
Do you want me to be there?
You're soaking.
I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.
Look, we can do other things.
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
More confident, maybe.
All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?
Nothing.
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
I called Dan Koretzky because he --
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
No.  Probably not.
I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
It's a great song.
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
That way.
Great.  Super-fantastic.
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
I knew this was going to happen.
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
I warned you.
Would you like more tea?
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
Would you remember his name?
Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
Someone beat you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You have an active imagination.
Why not?
What will you do now?
He called you "MacLeod".
What about me?
No.
He sees me as a threat.
No.  I had to talk to you.
There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history?
It's some sort of party the town is throwing.
Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on.
Yes.
I didn't kill the watchman.
Not the same.
I haven't killed _you_.
Get out.
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
Life.  It is the gift and the under- standing of life.
A murder.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
All fashionably without heads.
Corey, you _owe_ me.
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
Your marks would suggest great injury.
Why does he want to kill me?
Why?
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
Do not turn your back on me.
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
Yeah.
The last four.
_Answer_ me.
Spare a chair?
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
How did you find me?
I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
He found us even there.
The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
Long time.
You've been here from the start.
Run!
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
What's the point?
Did you know the victim?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
My condolences.
You're a kind man to be sure.
You're one of William's kids, huh?
What doing?
Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
What's the matter?
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
You're Bruce Baldwin?
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
Anything the matter?
How long would the interview take?
Well, I'm independent, too.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
What's this?
Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
Duffy! Get Liebowitz!
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
What do you want?
Done what?
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
Sure you can. Come on.
You've had a better offer, eh?
Sweeney.
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
You can't sell me that, Walter.
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
Thanks...
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
You said it.
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
All the words you've got.
Hildy!
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
Look at me, Hildy --
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
Don't open that!
No, you don't! Walter!
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
Flip a coin.
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Are you referring to me, Madam?
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
Walter!
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
How much?
I don't know --
Are you gentlemen all through with me?
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?
I call. What you got?
Who locked the door?
Hey!
Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
I'll call.
We know what you're up to.
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Gus, this --
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
He's harmless.
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
What is it?
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
A sight for sore eyes!
I won't.
Got you, Williams!
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
Where's the old lady?
Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
Look out, you --
Have you got my dough?
You know it is!
Hiding him where?
Mother!
I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
They'll get him! They'll get him!
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
Why not?
No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
But how do I know...?
Look out!
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right. 
Can I try?
This is going too far, young man.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way.
Who with?
I did see them. I did.
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
What's that?
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
Boy, that was some air-raid.
...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
What about it?
Why not?
Here's to music. And absent friends.
And what's that?
Why didn't they say that before you started?
When do you think you'll get leave again?
He always knows.
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
What is it, pet?
What did he say?
I can't do it. What's the point?
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
It's all better left unsaid, Grace.
I wish it could all have been different.
To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
Tiny's home.
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother?
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
That's not something to joke about.
I'd like to see that.
He walks, duh.
Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
It's a hitchhiker.
What was that?
Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there.
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
I like sleep.
Honk at him. Scare him.
Fuck! We are fucked!
Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
Why are we stopping?
Go around him.
Well, I got some bad news and some bad news.
Check this out.
How much is a person supposed to stand?
No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
So what?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
What are you laughing at?
Hello...  ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
Great. I thought I felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in.
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.
Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
This is way too fucked up for words.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something.
What should I do?
Hey.
Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
Mr. Willis?
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced.
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
Over.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
My little French.
What is it?
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
Please. I look a mess.
I've moved on.
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
Lila?
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
No.
You what?
Nice night.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
That's what I'm counting on.
You still in the market for a real boy?
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
You really enjoy my company?
Oh, and the sun block?
Come on.
It's perfect!
Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.
What are you doing in there?
Who is it?
Who from work?
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
It would just be helpful to know.
That's great. It's a great color for you.
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
Bravo to you, Puff!
I think he's ready.
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
So he's doing okay?
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.
Yes.
Pittsburgh?
Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.
About sixty, seventy bucks.
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
And a fact is a fact.
I want to talk to you.
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
I'll make it up to you.
Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
That seems a shame. The night is young.
Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
I never saw you do anything else.
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
No, we don't talk. I don't make bad bets. Seventy-five, twenty-five. That's it.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
Please don't get off me now.
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
Maybe. You want to play?
Who's he?
You name it, we shoot it.
The expensive kind.
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
Well... well, now.
It's quiet.
Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
You don't need a drink.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
Oh yeah? Where?
HOW MUCH?!
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
Findley.
There it is. I'm broke.
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
Hey, uh, mister? Hey, okay if I grab a cue?
Who's he?
How much are you ahead?
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
How long have you been waiting?
Have a nice trip?
It's the lights. And the scotch.
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
You don't look like a college girl.
Why did you do that?
A day like any other. People come, people go.
How did you know my name was Sarah?
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?
Don't you ever cook anything?
Oh, cut my finger.
Eddie, what's in that case?
What are you writing?
Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.
You glad?
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
I hear you've been looking for me.
Boy, he is great! Jeez, that old fat man. Look at the way he moves. Like a dancer.
Very good shot.
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
I came to play pool, Fats.
How much do you remember?
What about... now?
Yes.
When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
Why don't you start with me?
Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
That's who you are too, Emma.
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
You and that damned garden.
So, what do you do?
Son ... are you awake?
There are more this year than last.
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
Mr. Gardner, I --
This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?
That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?
Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
Does it look to you like anything landed here?
No one comes here after dark.
Don't go in.
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
What's his family background?
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
What?
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
You still believe in him.
Are you all right?
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
Love was never our problem.
Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
A countdown to what?
David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
You punched the President in the face?
This I can see.
Thanks, Pops.
What the hell are you doing?
We're loose!
Is my wife in the air?
Any news on my wife?
Where are they?
And our forces?
We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
A meteor?
You're late.
Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.
So, what do you do for a living?
I shouldn't have left her.
Damn it!
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
How' he doing?
I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
And before here?
What about you?
Marcus!
Henry, the pen --
Look what you did!
Schneider?
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
Doctor Jones?
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
The Ark of the Covenant.
It must be one of these...
My room!
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
It's important!
Found it.
...you did it.
You did!!
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
And the chair.
Come on, Dad. Come on!
Stop!
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
Marcus would agree with me.
That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
Dad, are we hit?!
Now, who are all these people?
Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
Ready?
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
I don't need camels.
Where's my father?
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
Who are you?
The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
You understand what he tells us?
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
What's that?
Indy?
I ride with you, Indy?
What does it mean, Indy?
Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
Let up on the brake!
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
You will go to palace there.
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
Took what?
And then they took their children.
What'd he say now?
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
A what...?
Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai. He was living on the streets.
By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?
What about the future?
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
I've always had a weakness for folk dancing.
Not leftovers?
You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
What?!
What?
So now they believe me.
What're we going to do?!
The last Sankara Stone.
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
Al.
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
Do me a favor, Al.
Yeah...Who?
I told you, my name is Al.
Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
Of course you do!
What was that?
No they won't.
I wouldn't say that.
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
JOE Or what?
What do you mean we.
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
Door's locked.
Just walk down the hall?
A lab and equipment.
Gone where?
Who is it?
I can't do that.
It's just not enough.
Now what?
Holy shit!
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
She doesn't seem to understand.
Where are you going?
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
Get close to them.
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
Which one?
Just don't show fear.
What is it?
You got any books in there?
You shut down your sensors.
What Happened?
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
Ow!
What?
I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
He hung us up dry.
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
Do it.
Holy...
Do something.
What happened?
Never mind that, where are we now.
Gimme a minute.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.
You're a lucky man.
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
Sorry...
What is your name?
Nice?
I knew you were trouble.
How about a deal?
Surveillance Cameras?
You have nothing...
Sir?
I don't want to intrude.
It is to me too.
...Foreign service.
Right.
Don't you want to get out?
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
Al?
Ahhh...nothing.
Was quite excited, when he came in...
Don't do it!
The fresh tuna?..
What do you want?
What?
Oh...and who is it!?
What way?
Wait. What's your name?
I waited for you.
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
Who else is interested in me?
Why did they leave?
He didn't.
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
You're leaving.
I'm leaving too.
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
Hiroshima.
You don't believe me.
And you?
Now what?
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
Why'd you ask him.
Why not?
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
Kiss her you fool.
He told me what to do.
Yeah...I have to get away.
You can't take that.
Mom...what are you doing here?
This the only spare?
It'l take months.
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
He's into kind of little cars, that...
Mom.
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
Push it.
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm afraid you are.
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
You can't take that... It's personal property...!
Debbie...
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
Mike... Mike... Mike...
Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"
Hey, Lowell.
You ready...?
I can take her.
Right now?
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
...taping?  What are you taping?
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
No classes this morning?
Let me see this... No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times.
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
Yeah...
Area code 212-555-0199.
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
I disappeared on you?
Did I get you up?
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
Mike... in my...
That Canada story? Still interest you?
Did work.
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
Seven dwarfs?
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
How'd you know that, Lowell?
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
Excuse me. Yeah...
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
What's changed?
"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
No? No, what?
Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert?
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
You greased the rails!
Did he hear you?
What about now?
Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
What do you mean there is no family?
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
Most certainly.
"I would bet on it."
Object to the form of the question!
Object!
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
Is that a threat?
You threatening my family, now, too?
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
Baby. You are so HOT!
And how is Mrs. Reiser?
I'd just like to have a word with her.
You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot!
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
I don't need it.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
What?
They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
Who was that?
What is your husband's profession?
So who'd you hire?
You like kids.
I begged you to have a baby!
You said 'yes' didn't you?
Is Tong older than Ming?
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
Oh, for the love of...
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
To victory.
Hello?
Marylin? When did I say...?
From a -- girlfriend.
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
I want to be your -- your wife.
You do?
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
Hi.
You don't like me?
Comfy!
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
Hello Marylin.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
Rex. Get away from the door.
We are. And it's winding down.
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
So. Now what?
Miles Massey.
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
Herb wants to see me?
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Mr. Rexroth.
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
What the hell is wrong with you?
What do you think?
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
Hi, Sweetie.
Let me tell you something about Patty.
It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in—
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
We'll go into that some other time.
That's an evasion.
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
I knocked several times.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'm—I'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questions—I—  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
I'd like to have a talk with him.
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
Are you going to see him?
If you really mean it, I will.
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
Why; naturally, I—
You talk as if—
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for me—and maybe we'll be friends—  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
Don't want to talk to—don't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
Why, no—I—  Yes . . . I guess I will.
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
Take my advice—grab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
Of course I do. What do you mean—
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
Hey, Brat—!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
Darn clever, these Armenians.
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
Your ego is colossal.
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came first—then the tie—then the shirt—now, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that I—
Who are you?
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Here—
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
King—King Westley was in it.
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
Not a one.
This looks like the best spot.
What's got into you?
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
Sure.
I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away. 
But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement—  That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
What happened?
That's swell!
You're forgetting you're married.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
No, it isn't. I'm hungry and—and scared.
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?
Whatever you say, darling.
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
In about fifteen minutes.
What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady—
Yes—if he is your husband.
I've been thinking about you.
Hey—you not up yet? Come on—come on!
I said, the old man's screwy!
Collect?
Say, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants.  Yeah?  Sure, sure, I got your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department.
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
Send it collect.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
Yeah—the "big boy"—the Boss of the outfit.
Yeah ?—How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
Where do you live?
The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
And Oswald?
Recall any names?
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
He had his palm print on the weapon.
But why?
With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
Why?
You know damn well who it is.
You still questioning any Cubans?
Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
No, I never saw him before in my life.
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
I believe the boys got a couple.
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
Then who killed the President?
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Daddy!  Where have you been?
Are we going away, Daddy?
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
I want the truth.
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name "Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name "Oswald" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity.
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 
I'm not sure I understand.
I wouldn't imagine where.
No.  Never heard of him.
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
Hi.
My sympathies.
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
For sexual purposes?
Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
Post Office.
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
Time?
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
HOLD IT, CHIEF...
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
Why were you with him?
And you didn't tell the Police?
You got a good lawyer?
She sound scared?
What's she want?
Can I have a word with you?
I'm not a loser.
Help yourself.
How was your flight?
Can we stop for cigarettes?
I'd love one, but not there.
You gain weight?
You're not tired of it?
What have they told you?
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
This is pretty.
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
He told me last night.
How do you get it out?
Really?
Fifteen thousand.
"American President"
How old's Annette?
You talk them into it?
You don't actually do it that way?
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
I see.
What about you Max?
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
The feds. It's evidence.
What if he checks it?
Ray wants him.
I never lied to you.
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
Most of the times.
I know what it looks like.
Look, that shit ain't mine.
We'll just be a minute.
We can look into that.
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.
Not really.
What for?
I imagine shit needs to be done.
Uh-huh.
She didn't say.
Uh-huh.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
Oh, hi.
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
Jackie?
Are you getting that black suit?
It looks good on you.
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
And what was your answer?
What the hell you doin'?
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
How the fuck they know that?
...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.
I don't know. One of your friends.
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
Who?
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car -- mission accomplished.
Who's paging you?
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
Where at?
What for?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
Were you a disco girl?
Were you a disco guy?
Did you ever go I one?
About five years ago.
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Wanna fuck?
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
That's not what I'm saying at all.  You know where he went?
I'm carrying it.
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
Whatcha watchin'?
Guess where I am?
I know you don't know. I said guess.
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
You shot her twice?
What'd you shoot her with?
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
Ten thousand sounds high.
Hey, Max.
Comfortable?
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
You know who this is?
I'm alone.
How'd you find me?
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves. What she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money.
In a way, yes.
She's been there since Thursday night.
She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
Turn left.
Who is it?
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
Take me home.
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
Grass never did that to me.
Daddy!
You're hurting me!
Hello.
Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
Well, try, huh.
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
Daddy, what was that noise?
I'm too messed up to teach.
Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh?
Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange.
You think they're connected?
Dr. Carlson's dead?
Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
I can't relax.
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... I always admired that.
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
No.  I see them.
What's your name?
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
It's not healthy with it closed.
I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
Jake, is that you?
Why didn't you turn on the light?
The room!
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
Yeah, but for what?
And look what I got.
What's in here?
Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
What?
She looked good then.
I'm going home.
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
You okay?
We're at Della's.
What do you mean? Where do you think?
Can't you stop it?
What's it say? A hundred and two?
How high is that?
What'd the doctor say?
He's coming right over.
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?
I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
While you were in the shower.
It's just me.
Who else were you expecting?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
What's going on?
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
You look upset.
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Where have they gone?
Goddamn you!
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
I think I'm falling asleep.
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Please come quietly.
He'll never make it.
I'll page him.
Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
I'm sorry.
Speaking.
Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds.
You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
Still married, Jake?
I just need to talk.
Everywhere, like a plague.
The army?
I don't know. I don't know.
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
No one knows. They say it blew up.
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
It's locked!
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
What's that?
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
Okay that hurt.
Where have you been?!!
Jesus, God!
Kicker, anything?
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Pull me in!
What if you miss?
That's why I'm here.
I couldn't save them.
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
Rizzo, you okay?
Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
Did you like it?
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
Spunky . . .
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
Okay?!!
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
Close the fucking door!
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
Robot huh?
Barbie from hell...
No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
Kay-em you okay?
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Son! -- Out of the water now!
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
And incidental damages, if any...
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
What about us?
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
Probably out in the back yard.
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
How come you have to tell them that?
Home... New York?
Colorful, isn't he?
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
He lost it on the way up.
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
What? What?!
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
Where'd you get all this?
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...
Wait a minute! I need you.
You from around here?
Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there.
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream.
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
You love sharks?
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
Well... is everything all right?
What have you got there, Lenny?
I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
Easy! It'll tear right out!
What can that gun of yours do?
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
Hey Bleek.
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
Whose idea was it?
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
Charisma?
What's up?
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Hey man.
Did you hear it's yours?
What? I'm not made of stone.
What is your job title, exactly?
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
I rock a Harmony.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Why aren't you at work?
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Is the baby okay?
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
Hi Dad.
Dad, no!
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
I sort of already have.
What?!
So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
Only the one in my pants.
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
The Penny Saver sucks.
Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other."  "All that's missing is your bastard."
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
Hly shht!
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
You guys are playing music?
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
...Pardon?
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
That's me.
What?
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
...thank you.
What's wrong with her?
Where you from Walter?
Brian.
Can't hurt.
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
So how's it going?
...and I think I know why.
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
Who said he's my good buddy?
Brian I want him out of our car!
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
Carrie, watch for Early.
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
...never?
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
...Janitor's job.
What do you think?
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
You wanna go to Paul's house?
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
Probably.
It is right.
You got any money?
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
I hate this game.
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
Right.
Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.
I'm nervous.
I just know. I know you'll love it.
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
Come dance.
How old are you?
Sorry.
Miss, would I be prying?
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
What happened?
Who, Benny's little sister?
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.
You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
And you don't get shit out of it.
Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.
Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
I hate 'em.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
So, how many people live here now?
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
What's that supposed to mean?
Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
Are you crazy?
What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
You got it on the board.
You want me to what?
What are you talking about?
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
You think he's dirty?
Take it easy.  Both of you.
You still having a problem with this?
What do you mean, stand out?
I did another one last night.  You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.
Hello?
You know her?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
What?
Hello.
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.
Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
Don't you see?  I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing.  I sat with them all.  I held their hands.  I stroked their hair.  I was with them to the end.  I took away the blood.  I washed them.  Their crossing was peaceful.
What's this?
D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
Now what?
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
Do you like my dad?
Who told you that?
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
Well?
What do you think he did?
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have.  All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night.  They're all the same type.  All moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers.
As large as castles.
He's right, Kathy.
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
I know you're busy so I'll get right to it.  Did you know her?
Could you tell me where you were last night?
This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It says:  From Debi.  Please call me at home.
Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard.  She's a psychologist helping us out.
What have you come up with on the riddle?
As large as castles.  You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you.  There's only enough grids on the map to be half a board.
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
It seems like such a complicated game.
--but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
Well, I think I've had enough.
I think it's interesting.
I'm just curious.
I know you didn't
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
She died in a car accident.
It was.
I just don't want to fight with you.
I'm hungry.
Peter...
Hi.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
Because I know what it says.
You're right.  The killer told me.
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
Colwyn ...
Will your power outward.
Take the western passage.
That's a better one.
Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
There is nothing.
It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
You choose these?
I cannot reach her.
No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.
He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful.
The spiral begins in the west.
She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Once is enough, thank you.
Fame.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
What is that awful looking place?
Sugarballs?
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy.
Put me down, you lout!
Passable, pimple, very passable.
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
He will come for me.
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
We seek the Fortress of Krull.
We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake.
She has the power of vision.
Each to his fate, lad.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
Who speaks that name!
She bore you many children?
Knowledge.
It will not help.
Give me his name, I will mail him.
...Office 2702.
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
...Good...  But what's special in him?
...You moved too, didn't you?
It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
Why can't I have a bank account?
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
Who'll I aim at?
Come on, get down!
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.
It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
Risky business, isn't it?
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK?
...Don't you drink?
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
May I ask you a personal question?
What do you do, with the money you earn?
Yes?
How are you, Miss?
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
...Composer.
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?
I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
He probably just went somewhere.
Here comes the resume.
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
Oh the preacher's getting angry again...  Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
You thought I sent them?
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
The new store?
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
No.
I do love you... very, very much.
Walk with me?
From where?
That's a reasonable assumption.
Red flags man.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
Each inch represents 150 miles...
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
What happened?
You're walking to California?
I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
I missed you Kris.
I haven't been too punctual with the rent.
Come on Mr. Parker.
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now.
There are a lot of people worried about you.
What do your friends call you?
I don't have kids.
You're pretty drunk.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
How long have I been here?
Sera...
Sera... what you don't understand is...
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
I'm going to fill it right now.
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
I don't understand any of that.
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
There are limits.
I wanted to see you...
How'd this happen?
A full night on the street and this is all?
Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.
Were you with another man?
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
What?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
Did you hear a shot fired?
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
Why didn't you call me?
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
-- his life?
I didn't even get to go to his birthday party.
You ready?
God, that felt great!
Good one.
Uh -- family.
It's not my alibi to tell --
I'm a bitch.
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
We still love you. Sisters forever!
Here. You're gonna need this.
It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
You have Stromwell.
Don't ask.
A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network.
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
So?
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
Almost.
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
Neither.
It's pink.
Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
You're beautiful.
And I fully support that.
East coast people are different.
You got into Harvard Law?
Good. Good.
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
Hovering?
We come watch... we come watch...
What?
We watch... good fun...
You're magnificent.
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
And you... are you not also afraid?
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?
Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
There it be, lad.  The Lindfarne Mound.  Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep.
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
Pregnant, is she?
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
This is ogre's magic.
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.
Certainly understandable.
I pray always to be worthy of it.
Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
Wait!
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Wait, Jack.
Water doesn't burn...
What magic have we on our side?
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Will you explain what's going on?
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
I was with the Princess.
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
But you did... you did!
A promise is a sacred oath.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
They tricked you.
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
Biting you?
Step lively now!
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
And charmed, of course.
Wondrously so.
Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
What's she doing?
Sorry, Jack.
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
You're with us in battle.
Lost?
Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.
Dad's disappeared!
I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
And video games after!
That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?
Red.
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
What are you doing up so early?
I'm going to bed.
Atonement.
My keys.
I had them in my pocket.
Can you keep Sam straight?
Did you feel anything?
They're trying to make me spend the summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning.
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
Really?
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
Why are you so uptight?
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
You hate your father.
You'd hate him for the trick.
Where are you?!
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
He's at work while I'm here.
And of course the Beck's, with the...
Are you guys' friends?
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
Oh, yes.
Pardon me?
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
Is Alyssa home?
I didn't recognize you!
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
I'll be around to check up on you.
Because I live there.
Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?
It bugs me.
I'm not doing it!
I'm leaving.
Where are you going?
When are you going to be back?
Did you got through my pants?
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
Sun glasses?
I loved him too much.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
Can you build a house in four months?
Good for you.
I aimed high.
Because Dad left?
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
I love those doors.
One of you would end up dead.
No.  I was going to let you do that.
I did say he could go.
George --
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
I used to live here.
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
What is it?
Oh...with his ear infection!
Where's Sam?
You brought your kids?
I'll find something that won't kill them.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
I thought we were helping.
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
I'm married.
Is your back still killing you?
Are you going to kiss me?
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
I wasn't sure.
It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.
I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
I'm helping George build his house.
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
You never really trusted me.
Despite you.
No.
Hey.
What are you doing in my room?
She's doing just fine.
These are free papers.
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
Yeah...
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.
I got it... boss.
Can't you remember your own name?
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
Like this?
My daddy gave me this watch.
Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
Maybe we oughta find another place.
She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
You lost all our money in a card game?
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
I think he's hurt pretty bad.
Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
Man, this is gonna delay everything. Spanky's gonna be pissed.
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
So?
No, man. I want you to have it.
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
You want out of this place, don't you? Don't tell me you're starting to like it here.
What's up, Ray?
You still got that map?
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
Don't mention it.
You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
Judge must have money riding on the championship.
Let it go, Claude.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
Well, if that's the way it is...
You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
You sure it was him?
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
What'd you say?
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
Just put some mustard on it and eat it.
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
I know you're not talking to me...
What is that?
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
You mean Louis Armstrong?
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story.  Nigger, you crying?
Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath.
Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
What's the Boom Boom Room?
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
Where'd you get this?
ADRIAN!
Little Nicky.
Now will you get in the flask?
Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
All these good people have totally been led astray.
Where did you meet my father?
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
What's Nicky doing down there?
Did you just talk?
So far, so good. Now what?
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
I didn't murder anybody
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
This is baloney!
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
Hey.
Bus?
You know, I was the one who created Hell.
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
Boogerland!
Hey...
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
Look who's back from the dead.
You sure you're down with this?
This don't look good.
Which way did he go?
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
Come on. One more time.
So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
It's freezing my hands.
You have a dog? What kind?
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
No.
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
What do you mean, "possessed?"
Yes...
We're going to Jersey?
Nicky!
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
Off limits.
Why is that funny?
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
That just hurt a lot.
Hey...
Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken?  I'm neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either.  No human sculptor could match this greatness... don't you agree?
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
Answer the question!
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
Had enough?
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
What's going on, Logan?!
Why did you do that??!!
What's your name?
What's wrong, Available?
Yes... probably he was renewed?
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
What Quad do you live in?
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
Are you here to help me?
When did you begin to question Lastday?
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
"Beloved son"...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?
Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
We'll have to bury him.
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
Are there any other humans?
Where are they?
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
Are you ready to put him in?
I'm sorry.
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
Well? How do you like it?
You're not contagious are you?
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
You want somethin'?
What's happenin'?
Very strange.
Do you own a video camera?
How'd the camera get so high like that?
What a fuckin' job.
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
I was here yesterday.
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.
I want more.
Can I call you?
Hello.
Okay...
Sure.
Hello.
I don't know.
What deal?
What's he do?
Pornos.
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
You got him.
I don't. I don't know him.
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
Better.
What night is that?
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
Have you made any charges against him?
Where's Pete?
Yeah, Mack?
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
What's the matter?
We know that.
Who is this man?
He's not Madison?
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
Something wrong?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
Where's Alice?
Same one you were reading the other night?
When you didn't come to the club.
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
Give that a try.
Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
At sixty?
You like pornos?
I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
Hello.
Who is this?
Last time I saw you.
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
Where'd you come from?
I didn't know you cared.
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
A what?
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
Well, that's that, I guess.
What are we going to do?
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
Hey, what's happened to you?
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
And mine's Conway.
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
Oh, good heavens, no!
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
—buy and sell?
He amputated his own leg?
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
Are you taking me?
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Bob! I think I hear motors!
Just what I needed too.
Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
George, what are you going to do?
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
I don't know.
Well - I mean—
Porters?
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
George, what do you think you're doing?
Let me up! Let me up!
What about the porters?
George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned—
George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
What's she got to do with it?
The clothes?
Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
That fellow got on at Baskul.
Good.
I guess we're in for it.
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
I'm so glad.
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
It would serve you right if you were left behind.
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
No. just peace on Earth.
It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.
It'll make sense later?
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Helluva night, isn't it?
'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
Vayanse. You others, go on.
This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
what's this?
The radio show?
Jesus...
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
When?
Goodwill...
Did he say where?
This it?
We need to talk to you about the alien.
How's Dee?
They're gone.
Actually, I don't know...
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
What?
I can't.  I have to know.
Oh, God...
The other two will die without me.
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
About who?
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
You don't have to do this, Chief.
Red Ball?
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
Flaws.
It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.
She spoke to me.
Are these all of her previsions?
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
She's a precog?
Are you reading my mind right now?
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
What happened?  Where's the rest?
I scored a goal!
Okay... now let me time you.
I forgive you.
I wanted to.
Who are you?
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
Something wrong?
What's so funny?
You're talking about the precogs...
It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.
Why?
You want to bring it down.
What safe place is that?
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
Oh, God, what did you do?
This is all my fault.
I understand.
Congratulations, sir.
Lamar, I found something.
Good God.  What was that?
So there is a way to fool the system?
What?
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
There a maid in this hotel?
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
John Anderton was my friend!
He looks familiar.
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
Yeah.
He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
Now, Mr. Slade, you're in room 315.
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
It's on West Broadway.
Will you leave me alone, already...? No, Sean, it's over... I don't care... As a matter of fact, I am... Yeah. In his hotel room...
He's great, right. Is he great?
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
What's wrong, baby?
Oh my god. What happened?
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
Goodbye, Bobby.
Whu --
But what about them?
What's up? Jess ready?
Why isn't Ruiz coming?
Where is this happening?
Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
This is it.
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
I didn't say that.
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
A bad heart.
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
'Trustafarians?'
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
Can you check?
So, it was a draw.
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
Fuck them.
We need guns.
Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
I like it.
How'd you unlock my phone?
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
I don't know.
It's ours.
See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go.
Who you calling?
How much is it?
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
Motherfucker...
Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
Yeah. What vibe?
So is this the drop?
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
You gonna shank him in the shower?
Nothing, man.
The penguin house.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
No.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
Three and a half hours?
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
Where's the surprise?
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
Cardiff Giant?
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
What's up, man.
Yes?
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage.
How much is what?
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
It means you got a gun?
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
See you later.
What do you want?
Coke?
Come, now. You just got here.
Yeah.
So whenever we want...
So you're our own private guy?
You know my pager number?
A lot of Persians?
Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?
Thanks, man. You need anything, you call.
Can I borrow a piece of --
That money is your per diem.
Yeah.
Don't worry. I get it.
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
I am.
Dip?
I'll get it.
Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle.
Keeps me out of the army.
I like your heart and I like your style. You might just do, Little. Lessen you got to git back to that train job.
It hit?
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.
Shit, what else she gonna say?
Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
Man live by his rep.
Who the hell are you?
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
What did you give it to me for then?
You ain't lying.
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
Little.
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
The body is a holy repository.
We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true.
Make it plain.
What?
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
Could we sit down someplace?
That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
Did you hear what I said?
Talk about what?
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
Dear heart, where are you?
Brother Earl.
Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
Now just a moment, just a moment --
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
Are you Elijah's pimp?
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
I mean it's late, baby.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
Get out.
How many you turning out?
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
You're my father.
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
You will, baby -- if the time come.
You had the number.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out.
Who the hell are they?
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
[Who's the boss?]
[What money?]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[I don't know, I swear.]
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
What is it?
So what's wrong?
How long you staying, Crease?
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
You got three of the fuckers. All dead.
Stomach's gone. But... okay.
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
Hmmm?
And don't start crying.
No.
Well, I let him go.
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
Could I ask you a question?
You think too much?
The world of our children. How dare they?
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
You're lying. I don't believe you.
Where are you?
Yes, mom?
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
She likes him.
[I know this. Your point?]
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
Who you gonna call?
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
When was this?
My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.
Well, that's all. You will see. Today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being a single man. I'm tired-a running around." Then he's gonna say, "Hey, Ma, wadda we need this old house? Why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? A nice little apartment?"
I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?
...When I got outta the army, Clara, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old, what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? But I wouldn't graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if I made it in three years. And my brother Freddie wanted to get married, and I had three unmarried sisters -- in an Italian home, that's a terrible thing. And my kid brother Nickie, he's a one got married last week. So I just went to pieces. I used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. My mother used to be so worried about me. My uncle Mario come over one time. He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. He got his own cab, you know. And God forgive me for what I'm gonna say now, but I used to thinka doing away with myself. I used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what I'm going to say, I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
Wadda you think?
It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there.
This is the kitchen.
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
You say something?
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
What time is it?
Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
What?
It's loaded with what?
Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.
I said, is she Italian girl?
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
Waddaya mean, Ralph?
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
He coming home right now.
Well...
I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
Marty, I don't know how to tell you how much I appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. So my mother comes in...
Tommy!
Tommy...
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
What are you going to do with him?
Stop him! Stop that man!
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
Don't you use olives?
Epidural hematoma?
Y'all mind the store.
You – must – open – me – up – again?
Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
Wisconsin.
What?
We got to stop them right here.
You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
You got directions?
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
Well, there it is. Jesus!
Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
That there Frank Burns is a menace. Whenever a patient croaks on him it's either God's will or somebody else's fault.
Hail to the chief! We-all got a responsibility, men. He's crowned like a king ought to be, but he can't just walk to the Mess Hall by himself. He has to be carried by native bearers.
Never mind. Forget it.
Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
I have a tent to myself.
We think the same way.
Give us this day our daily...
I was just asking...
What for?
...But I turned in my knee pads.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.
Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
But I'm married.
And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
You're on his side all of the sudden?
You're asking for somebody else?
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
Yes, Reverend?
He's coming to.
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
In the direction you want to go.
I have not understood what you means.
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.
What's going on? Who started this?
If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen.  And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
What's the bastard really like?
Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays.
Action?
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
Oh. Yeah.
Hello, John.
Can I help you pack?
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
How much money do you get?
Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
Hello. Whenever there's a pretty woman around, er—  This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell.
Thank you very much for everything.
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. Well—I don't quite know what to say . . .
Oh!
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
That's your father's diary, Ann.
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
We'll get a handwriting expert to—  What!
Say that again.
You made it up.
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it?
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulled—the Governor's starting a libel suit—what's more, they all know John Doe's a phoney—and they insist on seeing him.
What's the idea?
Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
Had any schooling?
Yeah, Boss?
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
St-rike!
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
Join the John Doe Club.
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myself—I get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jefferson—and Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
Listen, pal—this fifth column stuff's pretty rotten, isn't it?[11]
Sure.
Don't write 'em? Why, that gold- grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and—
Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut and—I'll eat him.
What's your name?
Why, certainly. With your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
That's a lie!
Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.
Pretty good?  Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!
I know one way you can do it.
Say, who's putting up this dough?
Is there a crowd in the street?
Hello, guys.
No shit! He's good!
Where's the stereo?
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
Where did you find an old recording like that?
Don't make do it, Mike.
Really?
Hold on a second here.
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
Anything on Korda so far?
What do you got on Korda?
You don't have to come here.
Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
For now that's all.
I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
You'd never been out of New York?
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
We see each other every couple of months.
You know the ten commandments?
You tell me.
What did you see?
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
So what do you want?... An autograph.
To run last?
Is it always like this?
He's got the girl.
You're crazy.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
How many have you lost?
That's a chance I gotta take.
Is the hostage injured?
I worship you.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
Hey.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
I wanted to get this out of the way.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
Scottie, Scottie...
Stay here, don't move.
Hmm?
Yeah.
Scott...
You crazy? With all those people around?
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
Are you going to make this hard for me?
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
Roper...
They have nothing to do with this --
System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
Why?
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
But this is impossible.
Divinity?
But once the system touches the net, all links are severed.  Everybody dies.
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
Corporate fingerprints all over it.
Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --
Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
What did he tell you?
There was no need to kill her.
What brings you inside?
Someone you have to get back to?
You went to my high-school?
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
I wasn't with you.
Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?
Don't know what you're talking about.
It was just there.
Transmit copy of program via satellite north uplink.
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
He's on us!!
Ay, yi, yi, yi.  The legend speaks of a Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos... This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power.
Wow.  Sand.
Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
I heard that!
Anybody see anything?
SABER TOOTH TIGER!
Release the power WITH the power.
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible.
You okay?
All systems go!
Let's go after him!!
The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
Hey, boss!
Just shut your gap!
But boss, what about their parents?
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
"Basically".
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.
When my money moves, I go with it.
Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
Four-twenty-eight.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
Masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. But his patience won't hold out much longer.
A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.
Well...
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
You here with Bobby?
Something came up.
You could have stopped him.
Would it be painful for you?
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem.
I been thinkin'...
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
I like that.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
This business is about taking risks.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
Boss, I got all the time you need.
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.
Not stupid. Fat.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
Forget it. That's past.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
Forget it.
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
Best we got.
Take any one ya like.
You're fuckin' crazy.
Who did this?
What?
Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
Death! Thank you!
Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
You're really gonna pop the question?
Holy shit.
Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
Where'd he go??
Stu...Stu...
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
Is there something else I can do for you?
So, what do you think?
You know, you never tell me anything.
Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
Mother, I ...
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
I see.  How much?
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
And while you're at it, get me a bed!
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
Did you like the first act?
Why do I always laugh at that?
How about getting married?
Any time.
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
Yes, Joe, yes--right away. 
Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--
Dinner, Hubert.
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
He's batty!
One minute! Just one minute!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
Yes. Come in.
Washington!
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
Well, it isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's. 
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
I will, sir! I will!  I--I don't know how to thank you. I knew, if any man could help me--
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
For a *question*.
Mr. President--
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
Good evening, sir. I was just making some--  Governor Hopper!
Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
Can't you?
What's your name?
Is--is something the matter?
Whose statue is that?
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
What?
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
Pardon?
On paper?
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
Abigail.
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
You--don't know it, do you?
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Already? All these letters?
Hello.
Well gee--how--how've you been, Saunders? I--I haven't seen you in-- . I suppose--now that you're married--
What are you going to do?
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
Where do we go from here?
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
Oh--you are!
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to--  Uh--how's your father?
That's--that's splendid.
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
"--We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights--"  Well--looks like the night shift's comin' on.
Marvelous! And what would this camp set the Government back?
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
Chick--
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
Every word that boy said is the truth! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! Expel me--!
That Happy Hopper is tougher to handle than a prima-donna.
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
No. Don't ever want to go out without telling us.
Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
Any children?
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Are they true!
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
You fainted.
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
There's Times Square.
Here's a nice place.
What did you mean by that?
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
Ready?
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
You haven't gotten very far, have you? That's where you were an hour ago. Come on, let's knock off and go down to Joe's. The gang's waiting for us.
You're acting like a school girl.
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
Look, I can do it!
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
Can I have a month's vacation?
Did it?
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
Gold, eh?
I wish you luck, sir.
You can't come up here!
Miss Bennett please!
I can understand that.  We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later.  Goodbye and thank you.
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
Will you have a cigar?
Why not? Who is he?
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
No, I'm his housekeeper.
Thanks  Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to—
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
We provide opera.
The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!
You remember, Dr. Fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples.
—my wife wanted me to tell you she—  —she prays for you every night.
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
Well, I don't know. I—
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
Uh-huh.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet—  —thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
That ought to be fun.
Who are they?
How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
What is your name?
Where is your farm?
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
Yes, sir.
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
What do they want from me?  What have I done that's so wrong?  They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something...  Even you probably have things.
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
You can go out there if you like...
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
You do seem much more disposed toward him than I understand, Ernest. Did I miss something?
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
I have eighteen more minutes!
Why? I'm paying for this.
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
How long you been in this town?
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
-- you crazy? You can't do this!
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
But you know how to drive?
I just got my license two weeks ago.
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.
What?
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
I can give myself a headache instantly.
That was really bad, wasn't it?
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew...
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.
Would you like another beer?
I've got three big ones.
This is great!
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
A doll?
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
"Get to know your therapist."
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
Sorry...
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
C'mon, friend.
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
Where's your new friend?
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
Immune from what?
The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
The sun turning black.
You lie.
Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
A bright good morning to all.
So who's the broad?
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
Every damn day.
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
For what?
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
Why would I do that?
I think you were jealous
Have you no respect for the dead?
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
I found it, Evy! I found it
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
She's my sister, actually.
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
That thing gives me the creeps.
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
Everything's going exactly as we planned.
Where are you going?
I thought you were done?
Do I?
Eat your mustard.
But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".
Hi.
Who's the artist?
Come here.
Or talk?
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
What's your real name?
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
At the Frankenstein Center.
So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.
You drink too much.
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
So what else has Superman got?
This place is built like a fortress.
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
Let's go.
Roy --
He's turned into a completely normal person!
But... only when no one is looking.
Firepower costs money.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
You did?
Be a Mohican.
Oh no.
Where am I going?
Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
I'm glad you like it.
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
There are none here.
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
No, they're living in Nice now.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Why didn't you wake me then?
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
Oh...?
Thank you.
Thank you, Napoleon.
Good evening, sir.
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
Only Lisette?
Promise.
Yes -- what is it?
Go away -- I'm busy.
But you will not... be safe...
No, one cannot simply ignore it.
Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles?  I asked for it yesterday.
Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
That's all I can say.
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
What?
You couldn't face telling me what?
Do you know what you're saying?
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
And where do you place Alexander?
A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
Come in.
Come in.
Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.
His moods at this time were complex and varied.
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
Stretch it out.
We didn't come here for Day-Day.
For sure.  That's how I like 'em.
Me neither.
Man, Day-Day is my people!
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
This you?
What?
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
$247.
You better stop running from that girl.
You go first.
I hope to God that dog is happy.
You're welcome, Unc.
Huh?
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!
Craig, remember what I told you.
I can't get jiggy with this shit.  Where is the damn manager?
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
What it say?
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
Roach...Roach, come on.
He's inside the house?
Money?  Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's all.
Where's Craig?
What you say?
If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent message is...Drop everything!  Craig is in trouble.  Come quick, don't call.
Debo!  Debo!
I can't feel my legs no more.
Hey, how you get out of here.
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
Where'd you come from?
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
You shot her?
There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
Good luck.
Daddy?
You're out of your mind.
He's dead?
I killed you.
How am I supposed to get away?
One thirty. California Ballroom.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
We have to hurry.
What do you do, if I may be so bold?
I said I have to do something.
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
Where are we going?
Close your eyes.
Where is he? Did you lose him?
Foreigners! Fuck!
And what happens if I don't call you?
Come Back.
No, Ben.
You killed two men, Ben Harper.
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
Where's your Mom?
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
You understand?
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
Leavin', boy?
Where's Ruby?
Yes! Yes!
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
Pearl dotes on him.
I must wend my way down River on the Lord's work.
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
Just a man.  Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
Now can I tell?
I'm hungry, John.
John?
Don't you hurt her!
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!
Where ye from?
Story, honey? Why, what story?
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
Now it's your turn.
Yes; John's bad.
Why, pray tell?
John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.
Answer me!
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
What's wrong, John?
What do you want?
Pearl and John!
You'll whip me!
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
What the hell are dreams, anyway?
Worked like a charm.
You okay?
Jesus, it's dark in here.
Yeah. So?
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
Much better.
The killer.
Bring him out of what?
Meanwhile...?
You used me, daddy!
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
What's the Coroner got to say?
Who? Who did that?
Maybe god's punishing us all...
Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
Right home after.
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
Mother, for petesakes.
You okay?
Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that.
I never touched her.
And then what happened?
What you mean 'all at once'?
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
What you dream?
What the hell you doing here?
When did you have a nightmare?
From Leon.
What are you serving?
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
An evening gown.
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
That's her.
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
Capitalistic methods...
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
Which lawyer?
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
Guest?
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Good evening, Gaston.
What time have you, Gaston?
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
Good evening, Your Highness.
We can wait.
We can call our ambassador.
Yes, Leon...
Leon, my little boy.
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
How much does this cost?
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers.
We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
If there is anything we can do for you...
How are you, you three scoundrels?
...and Kopalski.
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
Don't hold that against me... please!
Private.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine, and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side. The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees...
Then you don't want me to go there.
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
Do you hear that?
Let's forget that we ever met.
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
Room service speaking.
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Will you smile?
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
On which boat?
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
How do you do?
Thursday.
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
Are we going to build our little house?
...and we won't clench our fist...
No music.
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
Is this the wish of the masses?
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
Where are they?
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
You want me to go to Constantinople?
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
It's just a place for workmen.
Your Highness.
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
I'm still not confident we can ride through this.  Some people are going to have to go to jail.  Hunt's not the only problem.  Haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments.  Ehrlichman had a role, a big role, in the Ellsberg break-in. And I'm ... uh, I think it's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses.
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
To protect his people.
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him.
Where's Hunt now?
This is not a joke, John!
Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support.
We can't touch Hoover --
I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.
This is June twentieth?
Sorry ...
No, sir, you did not.
I don't have a pistol.
About a dozen.
Sir, the deadline is today.
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
I did?
But what are we paying him for?
"National security priority restricted and controlled secret."
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...
Cue the crowd.  Go to the woman's group.  Get the bald guy, he's great ...
But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave!
We really must go, Mr. President.
She got it, Bob.  A nineteen-year-old college kid ...
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...
I promised Iran to Townsend.
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
What'd he say?
Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?
Not if I give you all the cards ...
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
Mr. Castro.
Are you tapping Kissinger?
This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President.  Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.
By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency.  But I would never, never consider ...  His death was awful, an awful thing for this country.  Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
We took his system out.
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
By the way, Jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ...
Mr. President, we are in a revolutionary situation.  We are under siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve.  And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy.
This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this.
Mr. Nixon, it is possible for even a president to go too far.
I was asleep, Mr. President.  What can I get you?
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
You all right?
Get off that.  That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids.
Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde ... hi.
Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil war between the Vietnamese.
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
We got the press this time!
We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
Amen to that.
I'll concede in the morning.
What are you saying?  What are you talking about?
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I...
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah!
He looked old, didn't he?
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
Tomorrow.
And what am I doing?
I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ...
Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."
How many a those things you got now?
How you been, Ellis?
You're discouraged.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Well. Old age flattens a man.
...You ride Winston.
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
What about yours?
Probably must be.
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.
Don't get hurt.
What do you think.
...How'd you sleep?
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
I got it Mama.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
You can't afford one?
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
I can't say.
Where does he work?
...Where's the transponder?
How'd you find it?
Airport.
Who is this.
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
...Me?
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
This. And the gas.
Didn't mean nothin'.
Yessir.
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.
...Keep going. Don't stop.
I want you to take me to another motel.
November the 28th, last year.
Yessir.
What do you want to know?
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
What about one forty-two.
Waitin' for my wife.
...But that won't last.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
Cast iron?
I don't mean braze.
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
...You didn't take the product, did you?
The heroin. You don't have it.
...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
That is correct. And how do I decide?
I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
Nam?
...I meant your food.
You should get the order you want.
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!
Need something else?
Do you know why I'm here?
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?
It's all right.
Oh, you mean Fred.
Why do they keep calling you George?
Lyla's very nice.
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
Why are you doing this to me?
So, call me when you --
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
What was that?
Sure you don't want any salad?
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
...well, then you ain't got much.
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
What are you doing?
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
I got this apartment with a guy.
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
Doctor David Ravell.
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
Are you sure I can borrow this?
What are you doing?
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
We don't know which Buick, do we?
I didn't. You gave me a look!
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
Joyce was screwing Del.
No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive...
We should go.
Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway.
What doesn't?
Who's this?
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
I see.  May I?
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
What did you say?
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
How'd he know about the treasure?
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
Pete have a brother?
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Ass right.
...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
That's not my ring.
I counted to three, honey.
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
The preacher said it absolved us.
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
Fact of the matter - there never was!
This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
We prayed to God and he pitied us!
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
Who's the honcho around here?
Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.
It was a powerful air.
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
You, Zack?
How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Hi, Byron.
Who gave you this idea?
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
Go on, Zack! Go for the record!
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
I know.
Where are you from, boy?
I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
Yes I do!
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
Something tells me you've been here before.
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
What other issue is there, Sid?
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
That was you guys, huh?
What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
You serious about having him over?
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
And you turned him down??
You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
You got a girl?
Do you go to school?
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
Could you believe those girls!
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
That isn't true, is it?
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
Thanks for covering for me.
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
What?
What?  What do you want me to do?
Th --
NOT THAT ONE?!
Fuck.
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
Who is this guy?
Asshole.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
Master bath.
Oh, I've seen these...
That's highly inappropriate.
-- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five feet deep, forty-two hundred square feet, four floors with a rentable basement apartment, so five altogether, courtyard in back --
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
Makes me nervous.
478...
Fuck him.
I heard you.
Nope.
Oh, please.
Small space?
Morse code?
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.
What are you doing?
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
Why?
What?
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Alma I told you to...
No...
Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us.
...The police report says he was shot three times but the coroner's report says quite clearly that Denzil Dowell was shot six times. And two of those shots were in his armpits. Brothers and Sisters you know why that is?  Because Denzil had his hands up!!
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
God damn... Kid never had a chance...
Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker... I almost forgot how nasty that shit is.
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.
...Glad you came man.
Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?
Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.
Yes sir, I did.
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
Did you shoot the officers in question?
We're working on that...
Huey man I got to talk with you...
Alone...
We appreciate your help with this.
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
Shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up.
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
What's up with you?
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
Motherfuckers...
My Mom's at that.
Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum?
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Ain't no one seen him.
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
When?
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
Am I one of that sort?
I know that.
Goodbye, Charlotte.
My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
Very well, let us move on to...
How can we end this madness?
Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.
Is it?
How old are you?
These four wagons must be his.
Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
That's not enough.  Tell me.
There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.
An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?
You were an Englishman then...
We don't have to go to war to gain independence...
Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.
One of yours?
Fall, six months at the earliest.
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
Don't worry.
Not yet, Thomas.
Seventeen.
Father?
Who might you be, little Miss?
There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
Because you promised.
Ellie? What's wrong?
What's up, sugar?
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
Then why do I have to go to bed?
Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
God, that's fine.
The one that goes into the woods--sure.
Bagged cat. What a mess.
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
You and this old Indian rag-man--
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
Let her go. It's cool.
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
We got that part.  Anything else?
No!  You gave your word!
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
I'll watch my back.
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
No, I really think I do.
Why don't I want to do this?
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
You have a name, missy?
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
Difficult ... to say.
I know the code.
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
It doesn't!
You are despicable.
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
Blast it, I'm already awake!
How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
Raise the sails.
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
Not without my effects.
I'd die for her.
We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
Is that so?
I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
Do you have any idea where you're going?
Are you certain this is the right way?
Jack!
You haven't seen it.
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
What happened here?
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that.
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.
This is our world, Susan, and once you realize that, you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven.  Science is the quest for divine perfection.
I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
... plastic.
The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.
How apropos.
Like rotting meat.
She says it's not.
Icky!  What's happening?
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
Consideration?
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
Poppy, please --
Yeah, I do!
Yeah?  So what?
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right?  I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?
There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel!  Do you understand that?
Is that what Argon told you?
You're afraid of him.
I'm a scientist.  I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I'd give it to him.
What's it smell like?
Susan!
I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell.  I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly.  Exciting stuff.  I got to tell you, it really kept me going.
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
Susie!  You gotta help me!
Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
Why do we need it?
The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize.
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.
Look at this!
Just look at it!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
Just like old times.
I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
Susie... I...
We've got to get the nanobot.
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
Daniel, just forget Argon.  Let's get out of here.  We'll find another way to stop the waste.
You're not going after Argon!
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
If this nutcase did take it and has half a brain, he'd use it right away, before we could invalidate it.
What in the hell?
Indeed? How interesting.
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
You're not going to print this silly thing, are you?
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now—
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves—
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I—
Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them.
What's the idea, Anne?
That's an excellent idea.
Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
This way.
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
Yeah!
I bring a message from Garcia.
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
Yeah, little Gloria.
Why not?
—Mr. Schuyler .
And live on your salary, I suppose?
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey—  Let me know when you're quitting.
No?
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
Did you take anything out of those pants?
The boss is getting hoarse.
Thanks, thanks.
Ah! Thank you, Joe.  Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher?
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
There you are—!
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Then how do you expect to write about it?
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
Now don't be absurd, Smith—  May I come in?
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
What is it, Smythe?
Some bicarbonate - quick!
Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
Smythe, you've been drinking.
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousand—and you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
Nobody seems to want to do anything—  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
Stop calling me Mother!
Good morning, everybody—  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
Shhh! Do you hear something?
It's haunted just the same.
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
You sure you want to know this?
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
Oh no ... I'm fine.
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
You can't go out there.
Like a drum.
Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ...
It's six-thirty ...
Don't! Just let go.
Oh God! Are we in that episode?
I don't believe it.
Want some bridge mix?
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
What do you mean!?
Hello Bud.
What color is that hedge of yours?
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
Oh my God.
Can we do any better?
No way.
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you.
You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
You have no right to do this.
No. She really liked you.
Can I ask you a question?
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
What's going on?
Can I open it?
Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
Yeah ...
How much does it cost?
Why would I do that?
Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud.
BUD.
OW!
Because you're coming home.
There's worse places.
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
Wow ... That's pretty good ...
Oh, hi.
Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
Hey.
This is Barry.
...yes I'm still on hold...
Hello.
Please don't.
...please, I just don't want it....
You just said very food.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?
Why's it here?
Hey. What are you doing?
No.
...just talking to you....
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
Hi....what....what's up....?
Not very late.
You have trouble, financial trouble?
This makes me very uncomfortable.
They're not open yet?
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
Who is it?
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
You see?
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
Yeah.
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
Where do you have to go?
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
Ok.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Hi, is this your first time calling?
What do you mean?
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.
Can we agree that that is that?
It's alright.
This is Janice the operator, who's this?
...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?
Hey, good morning, Barry.
Yeah.....you got here early huh?
Which guy in Toledo are you talking about?
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
....now: this pudding?
Hey.
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
Yes. Sorry.
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
Ok.
This is this place called Ace Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't know exactly where this is and I don't understand these maps so just go there and check it out. It's a '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says is fine, but I need to figure out why he's only asking 23 for it. So take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it seems alright then I'll head down there and check it out.
What's the problem?
Yeah.
We should be going --
Are you ready?
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
Ow!
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?
Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
There I was taxed; it's true.
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
You mean to take us all down with you?
He can't do that to me.
I have a proposition.
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
Who's to say I did not?
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.
His wife's?
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
He'll do no such thing.
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
"A habituè of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
The peril of composing such incendiary prose...
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
They've taken your clothes?
"By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
-- words alone are insufficient.
I am eternally in your debt.
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
That poor woman.
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
The actor
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
Oh, why is that?
How bad is it?
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
I don't know what you expected with Joseph- fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is Hollywood, pal.
What are movies about, Orson?
We find the man and then we dissect him-
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
Oh for Christ's sake-
Yes.
Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
Fuck you--
Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
Jesus Christ --
Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word "Jew" and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool they start sweating.
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
Is that from one of the Gospels?
What have I done?
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you Marion Davies?
You're going to destroy it
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
This is an abomination There's no music and--
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how many people RKO employs?! You know how many people depend on what we do for a living?!
You're not still mad at me, I hope
How 'bout a real drink?
We're from...
They wanna talk to you.
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
This looks done.
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
Jack, I got no gloves.
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
Do you see her yet?
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
Nah, she would never...
Whatcha doin'?
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak.
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
I did keep an eye...
Did you ever fuck my wife?
I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad.
Why not? There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America if I didn't pull her outa the contest. Didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.
Nine o'clock.
He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
Jake...
Now take the rest off.
I like the gym smell.
But, Jake, I was just...
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
That he's got a pretty face.
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
No, not that.
I dunno.
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
Sure, what else is new?
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it!
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
Jewelry?
Did you ever own a saw?
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
Jefferies.
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
Something wrong?
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
Can you get me that ring back?
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
I knew it!
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
People have different emotional levels that --
A Federal offense.
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow.
Thank heaven that's over!
I wonder.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
Hello.
Yes.
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
Something big going on somewhere?
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
Yes.
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
So do I.
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
Huh?
Wasn't that close?
A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.
L. B. Jefferies.
Friend of yours?
How'd he get in?
Hey--I want to ask you something.
I don't think so--
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
Son--this is all happening so fast--
He depended on me.
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
Frank?  I'm frightened.
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
They not together, sir.  We don't see him in a long time now.
Can you tell me why you killed the puppies, Plato?
What's your name!
Are you really going to meet them?
What?
How'd you get here?
Come out come out wherever you are!
Isn't it crazy?
Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another.
Isn't he schizoid?
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for?
I don't want you for my father!
You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!
You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
Who's that?
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
Plato!
What?
Do I have to spell it out?
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
They never do.
Okay--
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Goodbye!  See you!
You cold?
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
Why?
Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
I never felt so clean before.
No!
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
Do you think your father means that?
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
Are you and Mom home tonight?
So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
Must have a way with stationery.
You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you.
Read a lot about you, Nick.
Is this him!?
Searching for a money man...
-- till he fucked his parole --
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
Gabriel!
You can't find... what?
Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four.
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
Well, I don't know about that --
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
You sold him out.
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
Nick died for me....
...maybe I die for Nick...
No!
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
I love you, Nick...
I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.
He wants to see your map.
How are we gonna do this, Nick?
What?
But I never said Rudy.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
I had better sex in prison.
Where's she work?
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
What'd they call her in college?
Hell. Ten?
What the fuck are you talking about.
We walked the place for a week.
Do I get a country-western name?
Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
Start singing.
No, you're not.
You gotta be kidding me.
You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.
Ash?
Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.
I can't go back to Vegas...
There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?
The Powwow Safe?
Cancer-sucker.
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
Monsters in the gelatin...
THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
Hell you haven't.
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
Just a roach, Zook.
Rudy, don't move --
NO!!!
Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
Do what?
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
POP! That was My card!
Switch seats with me.
That's what it looks like!
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
I don't wanna lift crates.
I'll call somebody.
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
A little.
The Brewers.
What?
What?
Mr. Brown?
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
Myself and Mr. Pink?
Just hold on buddy boy.
I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
Mr. Pink?  Why?
I know.
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
Follow you where?
Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
Gun shot.
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
What?
No shit?
So, is he dead or what?
So what is it?
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules. I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't.
You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!
Not these guys.
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
What's the matter with her?
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
You know so much about me -- figure it out.
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
I can't --
How does she draw?
Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
At the ranch maybe?
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
Oh... that's the time you went away.
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.
I can't take her with me.
What is it?
That sure smells good.
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
What's the matter -- restless?
Even women?
Suppose I take a look.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
You're so nice.
Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
She was only teasin'.
For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
My favorite memory was when we --
Really? That's amazing.
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
Shhh... It's okay.
He's right. I should go first.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Maybe we can study together or something.
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
Where the hell are we?
Let's get outta here.
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
What about you, Buddy?
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level.
Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
How about these buns?
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
Stop! --
This can't be happening?
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
What the hell are you doing?
Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
I'm sorry.
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
Yo! That jacket is tight.
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
Professor, what's the history of this house?
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
I got it!
Got a problem with that?
I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
I can do it myself.
The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
You never could feel your legs.
A little bit... Give me your belt.
Uh... I'm Father McFeely
It's okay. I understand.
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
Hi, Mom.
Oh, boy! 
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
Sorry, ma'am.
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
Detectives, what is this about?
You've been working in that video shop too long.
No woman would!
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
I love that you're my wife.
Shhhh..
Don't wake the kids...
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
So you do drink?
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
State your name, please.
And who may I ask is Carl?
He killed people, Mom.
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
What is it, Betty?
I'll give you fifty cents.
The name may not mean anything to you, young lady, but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours.
You can't tell.
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?
May I have some water? I'm thirsty.
Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
I've come from Jacqueline. She needs money.
I'll give you a check.
About forty-five dollars.
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.
And that was all?
This is about another murder —— a woman at Fifty Second Street
What brought you down here, Greg?
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
But I'm not joking.
All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
Who are you?
I'm tired of being afraid -— of waiting.
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me —-that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?
If it is true — there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him.
Jason, my pet ——
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
Tell me where Jacqueline is -— we've got to find her.
Perhaps.
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
What?
It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.
Would they hurt her?
Perhaps, Natalie, this is a bargain you're offering me --I am being allowed to join -- to buy safety by betraying Jacqueline -- is that it?
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it —— your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
Yes —— yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
...free-lance. You know.
Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.
Would you mind?
What?
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
Hi!
Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
And they just answer them?
This is just... so...
I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
What will you do when the money runs out?
Do you talk to him?
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
So you do fantasize?
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
Can't.
Her name was Elizabeth.
How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
Subtlety?
I've told you.
But you're planning to be?
All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.
I can't tell you like this.
Come on!!
You're not answering me.
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
Tuesday. I had a late lunch.
I'm not either!!
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
Why?
You son of a bitch!!
I have thought about it, yes.
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
What upsets you about that?
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas.  Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
No!
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
No, but I did.
In front of him, Ann, yes.
You couldn't do it, period.
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
It's a sun dress.
Bye.
The extrovert.
I just want to know why you're here.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
How did you find me?
Do I sit or stand?
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
What did he say?
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
No.
I've got to get back to the office.
I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.
Who said I was jealous?
Do you want me to stop calling?
That you... you don't even know the guy.
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
It won't. I trust him.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.
Student?
Not for three-fifty.
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
Answer him, goddammit!!
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Medical clinic?
OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you.
Where is he now? Do you know?
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
So who changes?
You put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it's assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney. I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say it's crazy.
OK, I bite. What does it look like?
OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
NIGHT NIGHT
You bet, Bert.
Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
You got it!
Infantile regression.
Out of self comes selflessness.
In a way...
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
That's us.

Mr.  Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
You shouldn't have said that.
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
I NEED SOME
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
. . .For his own good.
F for...
F for...
That's an extremely negative response.
YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD
CRIMINAL
This could be worse than the old series.
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
Isn't she lovely?
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
How's the trip?
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
Hey, guys. How's it going?
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
Great. You look great.  You both do.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
This is rose, right?
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
You know, you could work in a wine store.
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
Perfect.
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
Have you no shame?
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
Oh, boy.
You should call her.
What'd Christine say?
Where is Stephanie?
Does she know about Saturday?
Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
What do you think's going on?
Fucker hit into us.
We're on.
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
Let me use your phone.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
So what's the plan?
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
Well. That about does it.
Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
You want to join us?
What are you drinking?
Is she sleeping or...?
You got kids?
Yeah, weird. But great.
What's the title?
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Well...
Yeah? Like what?
Bathroom over there?
Okay. See you around.
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
You quit drinking?
French or American?
Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
Where's Jack?
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
It was a surprise, Mom.
What's the matter?
No.
Daddy.
...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
I see.
It was very dark.
This guy got on the roof in like a second.
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
Chicken Teriyaki.
This is going to do nothing.
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
That's good enough for me.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
I'm getting out now.
It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something?
They'll read our minds!
Did someone save me?
You said something was strange. What's strange?
What about them?
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
Is anything missing?
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.
All I did was kiss a girl.
I think we lost 'em.
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
I almost didn't.
Paden sends his best.
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
Offend anybody lately?
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
I gotta be going.
They got a saloon there?
Women?
Doesn't look quite fair.
Where you been?
I think I'll ride along with the lady here. Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado. See what makes a trip this hard worth taking.  I'll see you around.
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
Who is he?
Get out of here, Jake.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
Why him?
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
Yeah, it's working out real good.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
I took out thirteen dollars.
You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
It's the only place I'm happy.
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
What's this?
Where's the dog now?
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
You're not renewing my contract.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
Where is she?
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
Why not?
Hair and make-up?
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
-- You can't go in there!
My two favorite girls.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --
Where are you?
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
You look so, so...
What I do to Simone?
Simone?
You're with me to be close to her?
"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".
Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real.  Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people.
-- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
Absolutely not!
Is she here?
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
You have to see her.
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
Me too.
Can't you stop that?
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
-- I know, I don't know anything.
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
I know what you're up to.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
Is it a jamming device?
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
Mr. Sayer...
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
I beg you.  You can't do this to me.
Would you like me to read?
Is Miss Simone coming today?
Simone, are you there?
I am the death of real.
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Wow. They called you their son.
--My God.
Goodnight, Malcolm.
You're a doctor. What kind?
No.
I'm going to see you again, right?
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows.
You want to ask me a question?
Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--
No.
Can I ask you then?
What do you want more than anything?
I told you what I want.
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
You can see her?
Cole, you're scaring me.
Dead people?
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
How did you--?
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Bitch.
Dammit, Carl!!!!
There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
Come on --
Gene.
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
He means moon shining.
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.
You'll be back.
Never heard of it.
Down boy.
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
What are --
No Mac, please... I --
Mac... let's get out of here.
-- Where have you two been?
Bill, you're Chief of police now. 
Shit.
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
What you up to?
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
What's she see in that douchebag?
And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
Where are you?!
What?
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Are you nodding?
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
Hey there, Chief.
Megan Halesy' little sister.
Where's the old half--Mexican?
Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
Sure thing, killer.
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
Where are you going?
That's not true -- Where are you--?
I never danced in a towel before.
You're my princess, aren't you?
Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
I'll get if for you.
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
When one sees you they all see you.
So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
Get your hands off my daughter!
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
So tell me about yourself.
Anything?
You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
Christ, what channel are we on?...
Hey...
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
I'm proud of you.
He's just exhausted.
What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
No what?
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
You know how to drive one of these things?
You can't swear on these.
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
Bandit?
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
I hate to say it...
Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
-- How we doing?
How's the clock, Bandit II.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
Is that Bandit in the lead?
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
Oh.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
Is your security team armed?
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
You're sure?
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
That's probably him now...
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.
A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
My debrief --
...Does he know?
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
No shit.
So how we lookin'?
I'm working on it.
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
What were you doin' here anyway?
...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
You'll end up like me.
You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
Where's his body?
No.  There's no behavior modification.
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
How much sleep do you need?
What are you going to report back to Earth?
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
What do you want?
What plan?
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
Rheya...
Not a very happy poem.
Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
Is it a planet?
Then it's God, right?
I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time.  I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff.
What happened to us, exactly?
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
What are you talking about?
You're the coward.
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
But that's what happened before.
What's wrong?
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
No.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
Followed by non-human manifestations.
Gibarian was under enormous --
Occasionally.
I've never seen anyone killed before.
I'm supposed to call in.
You live in Manhattan?
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
Would you pick one out, please?
I'm sorry about what happened.
He said he'd kill me.
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
You could do better.
You put me life in danger.
I do care about you!
Yeah.
You told her?
What a memory.
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
Everyone's all right...?
Say goodbye, Mike.
You're planning to speak?
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
... just saying you should think twice about it...
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
Okay?
What shit, honey?
What did she say the down payment was?
She took you shopping for a tie?
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
Did you hear what I said?
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
What was that?
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.
Ellie...
He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.
Even Joey Venza?!
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
Who's Joey Venza?
Not Koontz.
I asked for the man in charge...
You should'a brought the girl.
Hold it...!
Bullshit!  Prove it.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
Nice threads Dad.
Shooting.
Here you go, Pete.
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
Flash, drop it--
Flash, get lost.
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
You get mugged or something?
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
Can't focus...
I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker.  I do.
Would you cool it already?
Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
What's this? A cockaroach?
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
Some prep school thing.
What are you doing this weekend?
Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them.
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
Well, no.
Peter?
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
I am old enough to--
A match made in heaven.
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
Jawohl.
What's the match gag?
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
There's only one pair left.
What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
I wouldn't worry about Schulz. I'd worry about Sefton. Remember me? I'm the stoolie.
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
Come again?
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
You were saying --?
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
It's chow, Animal! Chow!
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
May I have this dance, Miss?
I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
Betty! Betty!
Not yet.
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
We've all done a poor job of it.
Why the south latrine?
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
Go on.
You taking Dunbar?
You could use a new one yourself.
Shapiro. Shapiro.
Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player.  I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see --  -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
I'll kill you for that!
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
That is my wife.
All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged.
It's working.
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
That's where he's going.
Are any of them inhabited?
Population?
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?
Really? What do you feel?
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
Can you locate them?
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
Left behind?
Soran?
Can I?
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
Antonia?
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
Keep her together until I get back.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Well, now that we're all aboard=8A  Number One, bring the ship before the wind.  Let's see what's out there.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
That's a pretty big margin of error.
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
The royal...studs?
Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
Transwarp at your command, Sir!
What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Response?
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Aye sir, coding now.
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
Could it be Spock's?
Why don't we beam it up?
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
This planet is aging in surges.
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
Mr. Scott...
I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
Is there <U>anything</U> we can do?!
The Genesis planet is gone.
My God...
Yes, yes, Spock...
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
Close... There --
The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!
No.
Give me your hand and we both live.
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
But -- why?
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
Then, how --
He asked you not to grieve...
... Or the one.
Bones!...
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
Firing range, sir.
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
Shore leave, Admiral.
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
Khan could be down there!
But what if they went -- nowhere?
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
... taking Genesis away from us...
You did this -- in a day?!
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember  you in a wreath with Newton, Einstein, Surak...
Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
David. Please.
But the child --
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
Where's Dr. Marcus --
We encoded four minutes --
I didn't expect anything.
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
They're still running with shields down.
No!
Departing dark side, Regula.
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
Time's up, Admiral...
Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend...
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
She's not responding...
Mr. Scott on discrete.
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot‚g‚'s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
I know of your fondness for antiques.
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- !
You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...
Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station.
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
What IS working around here?
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
Very well.
I did not think so.
Reliant's command...
That was close --
Hold your course. Look sharp...
I really must thank you.
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
He's not what I expected, Sir.
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
Certainly...
You lied.
The question is irrelevant.
Heard there was some excitement.
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
Bones, stay here.
Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.
An experimental device, doctor.
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
... I don't think he understands...
What's your degree in, dentistry?
Fundoscopic examination --
What's causing that!?
The top of what?
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
Status report, Admiral!
"Neutralized?" How?
Can you protect us?
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
You sure you won't change your mind?
Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.
Thanks.
Then --
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
What's that?
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
It's true... what you said...
Hey! -- Where you going?!
Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit.
Spock...
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Spock: Condition report!
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
Any luck...?
Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.
Admiral! There be whales here!
Full power, sir.
Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
If you'll follow me, Professor --
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
Don't you ever get tired?
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
Will he live?
I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain...
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system.
I don't believe it happened that way.
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn't anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes. When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves...
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
You must be planning on doing some hunting.
There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...
My name is Sojef, Captain.
We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  That was three hundred and nine years ago.
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
Sir, inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance... if we don't release him, he may destroy both vessels...
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
You need a haircut, Commander.
The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
All hands. Battle stations!
Initiate launch sequence.
Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
There must be some good people... even in this time.
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
I have helm control.
What year is it?
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology.  So is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.
Data... are you sure you're all right?
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
Where?
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
No... the door's too thick.
What's still there?
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
We?
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...
They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
What are they doing?
We have to stop them from sending that message.
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
Report!
Report.
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
I believe the operation is over.
Spock, that was actually funny.
Bones, why don't you see what you can do? Let them know we're not holding a grudge.
- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were spooning -
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
Would you care to go topside?
He's a DOCTOR!
What?
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
Torpedo room--?
Where IS the conference?
You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command.
What took you so long?
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
Stand down your weapons.
As you were. Lieutenant...?
Aft thrusters -
Aye, sir.
I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
I always wanted to try that.
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
Me?
I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
What is it?
I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates.
Close enough to beam down?
The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...
Captain --
Her own father...?
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
Praxis?
It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
A computer canna lie, sir.
That could take hours!
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
Do you know where you are?
Can you remember our father?
Why?
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
Remember him?
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
Ready, Captain.
We are losing dorsal shields.
You have a red shirt.
Why?
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment.  The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. I’d say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data .
At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
What is our approximate distance?
Counselor.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
Sir --
Anything.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
Right now, you’re thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
You know I need to verify this.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
It's not quite the face you remember.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
What are you doing?
All of this so you could capture me?
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
Yes.
Deploy the weapon. Kill everything on that ship. Then set a course for Earth.
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
My God...
Are we prepared?
How long?
Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.
Praetor...
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
How many Warbirds will you need?
But surely...
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
Benny, God, take it easy...
Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
Make any money?
Where did you stop last?
Recognize this?
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
Why did you let it get into a populated area?
We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
Hello George.
No deal.
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Ah... no...
Which way?
Money.
What?
What?!
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
No gas.
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
Who are you?
That's a big help. Where are you from?
I am husband?
Who?
What's the matter?
That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
When do you have to be here?
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...
Eh... yes...
What is hitchhike?
You want this ticket?
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
What happened?
Yes.
The captain...
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
It's bad.
Nobody knows.
I like this music.
Where are you going?
You don't forget anything, do you?
May I have twenty-five cents, please?
Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
The cook again?
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
Where do you think you're going?
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns.
Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together.
Tell him I'm not here.
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
No, sir. Radar.
Oh, Jesus.
How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
That's a good one, coming from you.
Maybe.
Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
That's not sayin' much.
You were lucky, Max.
Naw.  She won't call me.
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
So've I.  Too much.
That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.
Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
So there never was a death squad.
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
So lay it off to somebody else.
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
About what?
Commissioner Strickland.
Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
What's his name?
That would be no.
My God, Lenny.  What is it?
Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
Is this great fabric or what?
No more, Lenny.
And what about the guy that was following me?
How's Zander?
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
This is bad.
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
Mace... you're a girl.
You see Tran?
What is that?
He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something.
Hey, Sheriff.
The room key's in the car. On the seat.
You have the body?
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
Excuse me?
Look, mister...
My God.
I've been looking for you.
He was sitting here?
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
He said it was a clue?
I think I talked to him.
Speck. Harold Speck.
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
Its called insubordination.
How do you feel, Agent
Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
Why did you go to Chicago?
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
Dick Low's a killer too.
Miss me, Dave?
Thanks for the ride.
You work with Koessler?
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
He's called a couple times.
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
Start killing people for real?
You were right. He found me.
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
Mack must think Zero has a police band.
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
After my hiatus, after I got my priorities readjusted, I drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. Never found Zero, but I did come across some Class A scumbags.
There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
Is he dead?
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
If I owe, I will go.
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
Yes, sir.
Thomas Mackelway.
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
"Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.
Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
I don't think you understand.
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
You have to put things in perspective.
You've been through worse.
You should call your Grandmother.
You like laughing at the misery of others?
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
Are you sure? Maybe...
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
Like the quiche?
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.
To do what?
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
Charles! What's up, man?
...not until you book it...
Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number...
You haven't told then, huh?
Let me just check on my boy.
Always...
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
Oh my God.
On the table.
Do you have anything smaller?
Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.
Who's your booking agent?
Well, who represents you back east?
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
Well... This is it.
It's not going to well?
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
Lorraine?
Hi. Sorry about that.
Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on.
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
Hi.
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
There's the rub.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
Kinda money, huh?
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
Thanks, man.
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...
How's it going for you two?
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
Good for you, man. He's being smart.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
Wait.
I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
Double down.
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
Always.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
I don't think so.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit.
I know. I know.
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
I gotta use the phone.
Christy was nice...
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
I don't think so.
Yeah, a good friend.
Don't remind me.
He drives a carriage.
No. Doesn't that suck?
What time's this party tonight?
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
Please, don't mess with me right now...
How long do I wait to call?
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
Oh, it's on, baby...
That was pretty cold, dude.
...we're not...
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...shivering...
You dick.
It's on.
And you?
Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.
The Court gave you justice.
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.  That little farce you played out with my sister.  Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?
What's the matter, Carlo?
The food is on the table.
You heard about your father?
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
You look terrif on the floor!
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
No.
You take care of your family?
Is it necessary?
What is this nonsense?
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
You mean Tattaglia.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
What miracles you do for strangers.
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
...a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war...
I know.
Things went badly in Palermo?
I know about what you mean!
Is the hospital covered?
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
We should hear what they have to say.
Jesus, I don't know...
Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
Will you give this letter to Michael.
Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it.
Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing.  They get a little more money than the job's worth.  Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
Then the legs at the knees...
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
Hello.  Kay?
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
Will you?
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?
That's not how Pop would have played it.
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital.  I came down late.  There's no one here.  None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one.  The old man is completely unprotected.
Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want?
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
You straightened my brother out?
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
Uncanny!
Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --
Who's this?
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
Good afternoon!
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
You're breaking my ribs!
I could fuck this icebox I love it so much.  What were you actually doing in New York?
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
I didn't mean with you in it.
What does he say?
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
What are you talking about?
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
What?
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
Do you think you can steer this thing?
Hello?
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
Freddie, do you have something to say?
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
I'm well, thank you.
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
Okay.
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
Oh my God. Tom.
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
That's a terrific idea.
Very.
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
We think he's had a change of heart.  So we should be celebrating.
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
So -- are you travelling under R?
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
And tomorrow?
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
That's good, isn't it?
Tell him I have a fiancée, Dickie has a fiancée and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
What did he say?
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
Are you okay?
Tom, are you okay?
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
How was it?
Or Tom and Peter even.
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.
No!
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
I have!
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
Nah, this'll be fine.
Is there a firing range around?
You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?
You like ball games?
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
Yes?
Where do you live?
The moon?
What hours do you work?
Where are you going?
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
Travis?
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
Just what?
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
How long has he been there?
Try holding the match like this.
No, why?
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
No, I'm serious, really...
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
Well, you ever need one, I know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal. Lotsa shit around.
For a fee.
Where.
20 bucks?
Yeah. From the likes of them.
What's your name?
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
Can I see you again?
God, you are square.
Why not?
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
How?
I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes.
So whatja do now?
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
I'm no cop.
Travis.
So howsit?
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Had a close one.
It's me sir.
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
I.don't get it.  You're going to help me?
Limp dick?
I'll go.
God's speed.
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
What about you, Delly?
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
Did you bring along something to read?
How'd it go?
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down.
What.
We were in love... weren't we?
Nine hundred...
My what?
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
Delly, shhhhhh...
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Yes.  A prepared statement.
I'm a little hesitant to say.
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
Wait'll you see the inside!
Why?
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too.
Ernie.
I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
Beautiful, wasn't it?
I'm here.
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
Pete.  You think maybe you've had enough?
Here, one of mine.
Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
What is it?
Evening, Luke.
Jesus.
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone.
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
You can't testify.
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President.  But it'll always be someone.  Count on it.
Cigarette?
When'd you quit smoking?
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!
Cat.  That's simple.  I like it.  Hi, Cat.
T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
Yes?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
I was wondering...
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
Would you like some brandy?
Thank you.
Then why did she object to you?
I don't understand.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
And the second?
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
They haven't harmed anyone.
Are you coming to my party?
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
Mitch, let's turn back.
No, it's Lois!
The two kids?
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
Young woman cut herself.
I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash.
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
They're gone. The same pattern.
They won't be.
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
These birds were...
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
I understand completely, sir.
Doesn't what make me...?
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
Yes, I see.  About those lovebirds, Miss...
But how... how do you know my name?
How?
I think you're a louse.
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
You like me, huh?
Why did he shoot her?
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
Why?
But not for me.
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
Are you all right?
Some cream?
What it was, probably...
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
Have we still got power?
When will they stop?
What time is it?
Can we turn back?
I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
How do you plan to do that?
How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
I'm only a student.
I didn't mean it that way.  I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.
-- pain -- and shock.  She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself.  Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Maybe He knows best.
It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?
Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
But Richardson?
We can't be sure of that.
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
I thought this was a school day.
Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
It might be an interesting case.
Toddy hates me.
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
How long ago?
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
You're not going to Gray.
You've been with Gray again.
Was that it? Well, ok.
You think I'm crazy.
That was a fucking hollow point!
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
What did they give you?
You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
Daisy. How did you know?
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
This is where it happened. Right over here.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
An accident, Nathan.
I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen?
Look, can I just call a cab?
They killed her because she found out.
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--
Hi Mom!
Tell me what?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
I thought that was only for bombs.
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
What does that mean?
Did all these people die in wars?
The skeletal structure is completely normal.  Same for the major organs -– heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
I don't believe it.
You must have come a long way.
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
I will make that recommendation to the President.  I must tell you in all honesty that I'm extremely dubious about the results.
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
Just twelve.
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
No. That's all finished.
You sure about that?
No -- no, thanks.
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
Why not?
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Should I run him through?
Two down and two to go.
We still going?
That's right.
We were gonna grab some food.
Where's Star, David?!
Leave him alone.
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
What's that smell!?
Oh, no...
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
Of course not!
Max?  You men we're having company again?
Hi... I'm Laddie.
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
You like Michael.
See you later.
-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
We're getting close...
Ocean air!
Tell them to get something to eat.
When you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to Berkeley, spent the night in Golden Gate Park and begged for spare change in the morning?
Help me, Mom.  Help.
Lights out, Sam.
What's wrong?  Tell me.
Where's Michael?
Say hello to Thorn.
Not impressed, are you?
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
But you passed the test!
Well... yeah.  Sure.
What's your name?
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.
I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?
Then it's not too late for us...
David's looking for me... I have to go.
Huh?
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
What happened, Michael!?
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
... It could have gotten to somebody...
How you doin', old boy?
Happens all the time, man.  They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it... Chariots of the Gods, man... They practically own South America.  I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew...
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!
MacReady!
... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
What do we do about those three?
Load of bullshit.
Neither will we.
Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
Well, who's got access to it?
I guess you're okay.
How long will it take you to prepare this?
How long's it been?
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
Tie up Clark, too.
Where were the flashlights?
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
What's happened?!
Yeah!
He's one of them.
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
Now how did you get hurt?
Ah... no.
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
When was his mother taken?
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
Why would you let me go back?
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
I'm tired of running.
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
May I help you?
... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?
Admiration?  My my.
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
Alex...?!
Let them.
I was not.
Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
In the future, we'll be better.
Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
It wasn't your fault, Alex.
Did you hear me, lad?
How long did you travel?
Is there a lot of illness?
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
How long ago?
Why?
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
Yes!
All of you?
The mud carriers.
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
This is where my journey started... right here.
Yes.
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together...
Kalen...
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
We have to go after them, find where -- !
You know that's not true.
You won't even try?
Yes, sir.
What did you do at night?
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
How did you come to know their names?
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
We're late.
This is really happening, isn't it?
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
I think I can remember what's on them.
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
I gave you my dog tags.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
I don't believe a thing she just said.
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
I might not be able to.
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
What?
I've been ok.
How you doin'?
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
Why, what would you do?
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
The future doesn't look different?
What about the world?
You told me this was how it happened.
William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
You know how to get there?
Becker does? Are you sure?
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
Well, how'd you get here?
What's this?
But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
Hon.
Hon?
'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
Hey.
You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone.
No!
We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in.  Someone will be here until we find them.
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
Oh.  I... where's Louise?
What did ya do?
Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.  You can go on in and take a nice cold shower.
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
Is that how you answer the phone?
And what's the mysterious code word?
Hey, peaches.
Will you at least see how it fits?
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
Whose place is this again?
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
So what if he was?  It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
Oh my God.
Louise.  Where are we going?
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
It means shut up, Thelma.
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
You could help me try and figure it out!  I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.
You're not touchin' that car.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
Call him?
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
Yup.  That's him goin'.  I love to watch him go.
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
Drive!  Drive away!
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
Thelma.
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
It won't work.
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
What little dogs?
Like a Chihuahua?
This is so beautiful.
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
I am really sorry about this.
What'd I say again?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
You awake?
Me too.  I feel awake.
We can live in a hacienda.
I mean really!  That business with your tongue.  What is that?  That's disgusting!
You know what's happened, don't you?
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
How far are we from Mexico?
What?!  What d'you think?!
Louise!
Isn't it beautiful?!!
God!  It looks like the Army!
Now what?
We been seein' you all along the way.
Hi!
Oh, Jesus!
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
I'm asking you to leave.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Stop it!
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
It must be great with a wife like that.
Nah.
I mean since then.
Well why don't you look her up?
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
Wait a second, I never told you that.
No You mean...?
You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
Mary.
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
Healy you dog!
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.
I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
I know he's around here someplace.
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
So...
Turn it up, Magda.
How's my stomach taste, she says.  Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.
Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
Mary's a little chubby, huh?
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
Uh, that's okay.
What are you doing?
Jai alai?
Mary's a mail-order bride?
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
Oh Christ... poor dog.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
Friend. Baseball bat.
You little fuck.
I see where you're going.
I'd go with the seven.
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
So who's the lucky guy?
I don't watch the new ones.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
Magda!
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
Pat's an architect, too.
Not long at all, but I really like him.  Okay, I know he's a little different, Tucker, but that's what I like about him. He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts, too. And that's okay with me.
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
I think you'd better sit down.
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
So you're a writer?
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
Please leave.
But but what about Steve?
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
Eh.
Uh-huh.
Okay.  So is that a yes or a no?
Franks and beans!
How are you doing, Warren?
See you, Warren.
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns.
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
Lying bastard. Lied to my face.
The other thing is...
Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
Zorin will eat him alive!
My father --
What's it about?
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
So what've we got today?
Still think Cuba isn't important?
No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.
Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
Let's get out of here.
Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
What's that?
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
It's transparent. The press'll be all over it.
I see.
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
Were you in Nam?
Six rounds. 357.
No. That's Ray here. Ray...
What'd she say?
Her oil pan is shot.
Alright. Alright...
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
Tread matches. It's the car.
And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.
I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
What are you --
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
What was he saying?
So what?
Still after Jimmy?
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
He's gone.
Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood. I used to think Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I know he is.
Your relatives must've taught you something.
What?
X22. Read.
With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --
Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
Get up out of the chair, Richard.
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.
How so?
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
If you were directly above him, how did you see him?
The what?
What would?
Well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something.  I'm sorry.
Yes. I'll give you that!
I can't.
Lieutenant...
And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
Anything.
No!
You're totally insane.
Come on.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
Food...and you...my F-14!
Just good luck.
You don't have to do this.
What kind of games?
You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
Want to play the game?
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
Now?
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
I live here, remember?
Can't shake him.
YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.
Let's hope you're right!
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well???
Let me do the talking.
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
The list is long, but distinguished.
You think you can stay up with us.
What was that?
Something bothering you?
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!
Mav's a great flyer but....
I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH.
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
You saved our lives. You did it!
You didn't help.
Yes sir..
He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
Would you like the same suite?
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.
Do you expect me to believe you?
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
Bob?
What the fuck is going on here?!  You can't install a simple goddamn double implant?!
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
I'm listening.
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
Sit down.
Shit!
Hey Harry...Harry!  You ever heard of Rekall?
They sell fake memories.
Hey, Quaid!
What are you, my father?
Harry, what the hell is this?
I want that fucker dead.
He's not at ground level.
I'm sorry.  Would you please rephrase the question.
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
Let me go!
...You mean it?
Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
What are you doing?
Harry from work...He was the boss.
--I got a trip to Mars.
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
And falling in love?
I suppose you're not here either.
Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...
Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits.  That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.  --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.
As real as any memory in your head.
Go on.
Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?
I don't remember you.
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
Forget I said wife.
So you dropped by to apologize?
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
Like what?
You sure about this?
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
You guys all set?
BACK OFF, BURT...!
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
You're gonna get us hung up.
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.
Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
Damn it.  What the hell are they doing?  They're up to something.
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
Yeah...but no ties.
Somebody paying you to do this?
How's she doing?
We playing cards tonight?
Down, honey, down.
Burt!  Heather!
I'm dead.  Let's finish in the morning.
Twenty.
Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
Think it's still following us?
I think the ground's getting closer.  I think we do it.  We're gonna save our asses here!
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
I will allow the witness to testify. With the understanding that your questions are confined to the area of Mr. Kim's modus operandi.
I noticed.
Look, I'm a lawyer and --
How can you remember that?
Not the whole time, of course. I --
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
-- a speed manufacturer --
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!  I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns!
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
Racist asshole came at me.
Afraid of what?
What went down?
...I'm dying out there.
Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?
...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer?  You left your telephone number?
I'd l-like to answer the question.
Back in the Seventies I spent years putting away gangsters in a Colombian syndicate called "the Ochoa". These guys are very dangerous, Ed. When I hear that a small-time dope lawyer is conniving to spring one of these guys, I see red.
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
I'll prosecute anyone who fucks up. If that makes me look racist, it's a trade-off I'll live with, Ed.
Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
Your Honor, that's trial by ambush!
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
I don't think I know that name.
I followed you here from court.
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
Mr. Ortega, what is Shu Kai Kim's rank within La Compania?
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
The phone company was broken up.
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
Go away. I am not talking to you.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
Here he comes.
Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
The stuff we got last night.
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
Well, where are you going?
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
Did you know Teresa Banks?
GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
Where am I? And how can I leave?
No.
No.
I see. He does talk loud.
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
The usual, 9:15.
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Oh god, Laura.
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
How did the car get back here?
But I love you, Laura.
Hey, Pete. Can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
Even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
We're on our way, Baby.
Why? It does.
It does matter. We're in love.
I've got to see you.
What about tonight?
What's going on?
Bobby killed a guy.
I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Dad.
The Norwegians are coming next week and I want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian. So you can talk to them. I want you to learn to say, "Hello, my name is Leland Palmer".
School?
Who was that?
No.
Oh, I thought I saw you.
Laura. What's wrong this morning?
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.
Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
...tell me about this case.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
You would not...?
I do. Yes.
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
Ed Concannon.
Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear that. You were her doctor.
Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
And what did your team do...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
I am seventy-four years old.
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anesthetic. Ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic.' Does that sound familiar?
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct?
And you wrote that...
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
Yes.
I'm sorry...?
Thank you...
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Thank you.
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.  I myself would take it and run like a thief.
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today.
I object, your Honor...
What Hotel are you staying at?
I've got to work...
Why don't you get some rest?
Well, then what are you doing here?
Not if you don't grow up...
Joe...  Joe...
Continental Casualty...
Mr. Galvin's...
We find that your subscription lapsed...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
Then why don't you testify?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
I... please. My wife... my wife's prescription has run out. If I can call him...
No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...
It's a long road that has no turning.
Uh...
...now who is that...?
...hey, I don't need your charity...
Come on. Let's get a drink.
Are you out of your mind...?
...Gruber's not bad.
No.
Right.
So what?
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
Yeah? How's our new witness?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
How are you holding up?
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
What the hell are you doing here?
We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.  And they resume seven minutes...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
Hey, how about that!
Hey, you!  Better get outa here!
There's nobody left around here now.
Hurry up!  Jump in!
Is that it over there?
Did you see it come down?
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.
You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
I never noticed before - that's a cowboy tie....
Is that... machine...?
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
How'd you guess?
The Rockies...!  You'd rather get back to that big family of yours in Minnesota, wouldn't you?
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
It's about that meteor.  They say it's a whopper.  The District Officer phoned us at the lookout up on the summit. Thought you might be interested... It's ten or twelve miles from here - over by Linda Rosa.
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
What'll we say to 'em?
I don't know, Bob.  I'm flattered and all, but I've got a kid, now.
I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
What if it isn't over?
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
He's had some sort of...episode.
Like Freddy.
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
Any history of epilepsy in your family?
Diabetes?
Like what?
If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on?
These look quite fresh.
Doctor...
No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
Heather?  You doing okay?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
What...happened?
You got it.  What's happening?
You're right.  That sounds crazy!
I want to see the body.
No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
Like the Genie in the bottle.
Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
But your instinct was to lose sail?
Make us proud.
I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch.  That sound good?
I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All right?!
I doctored my grades so I'd make the cut.  I'm a moron, okay?  You satisfied?!
You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
Feels different doesn't it?
That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
I thought this was your dream come true.
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
Why'd you do it?
Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  Because of you.
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
Do you have your ticket?
Good.
No way!
It works?
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
Ah... Northeast... sir.
The Dolphin was a symptom.
Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.
What's wrong, you don't like steak?
What's that?
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
Don't ever call me stupid.
What?  Come on...
It matters to me.
That's not a satisfactory answer.
This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
What?
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.
Suicidal...
I can't be sure.
They are much more than that, sir.
There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross.  I have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.
If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?
Whattaya mean family?
Couple grand or more'd give you two a leg up. Get you to the west coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with a few dollars in your jeans. I got it figured good, Sailor.
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...
Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
You hitched yet?
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
So, it's back to the islands.
Oh, many things...
That is my permiso.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's authorized to carry a .45.
He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
The Good Witch...
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl? Or are you gonna save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her?
I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.
Only that it's supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year.
General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez. Telefono 666.
Gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
What?
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Why we sittin' here, mama?
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin' a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin' that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.
What's that honey?
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
Actin' funny how?
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin', they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.
Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!
We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans.
I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
I do.
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
You think he saw us?
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
You knew my daddy?
Lula, you there?
You upset with me?
It's a comfortin' idea.
There's worse places, honey.
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired.
That you, Sail, honey?
Darlin', I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed.
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
You must be my son.
How can you say that, Sailor?
LULA!!!!
The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.
Just a place.
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
You're comin' home, precious. Santos' gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Wouldn't make any difference.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
Have it your way... But you want it.
Explain it... I told you.
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
Oh... Look at this... What do you want, snakeskin?
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
That's just how my brain works, I guess.
Actually... I just want to go home.
You all right, Professor Tripp?
It's the Chancellor.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
He is. Take my word for it.
James? My James? What's happened?
You know -- based on what I've read -- this is a very exciting piece of material, this Big Parade.
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
How bad is it for you?
Crabtree.
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
Such as.
The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
Who's got a gun?
Boy or girl?
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
...reconcile with Emily.
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
Really? That's remarkable.
Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
Oh.
The guy on the phone.
Afraid so.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Washed up?
Professor Tripp?
I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave.
Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
Kinship. And what's here?
Maybe she didn't come here.
Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
It's warm.
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
I'm sorry.
Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.
I'm not going, with them.
And we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine.
Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.
I'm a little worried, James.
Me? Sure. Why?
He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
Easy there.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
I'm sure.
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
Has he asked to see the book yet?
Well...
Not have it.
Who's gun is that?
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
And the jacket?
Did you tell Walter?
You don't deserve me, you know.
Who's he barking at now?
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
Listen, Antonia --
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
It's three-thirty, Grady.
Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?
Who's that guy?
Yo, Traxler.
Holy shit. Are you serious?
Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.
No, the dog.
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect.  Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.
Cherry.
Fucking Mariners.
Soon.
Carlos, can I ask you something?
Nothing.
What are you looking at?
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
Something like that.
You should hear the bird.
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
Were you watching me?
What are you writing in that book?
Cherry?
And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? Is that when you jerk off?
Okay?
Do you believe in them?
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
He I.D.'d the assailant. The description matches you pretty well.
What's with the boxes?
But you are taking it?
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?
I'd keep away from him.
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
Have you seen Walter?
Yeah, like the bird.
I'm twelve.
My daddy lets me sit on his lap.
But will he... ?
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
It's getting dark. Go home.
And how's your job?
I'd like you to keep a journal.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
What are you afraid will happen?
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
Why do you think you're here?
Go home, Walter.
Please don't do it again.
When did it all start?
I'd like you to close your eyes.
No, I am not going to --
How old are you and your sister?
Don't ever do that again.
Walter, what did you do while taking a nap with your sister?
You felt pleasure.
Did you get an erection?
Want a ride?
Are you?
You plan to drink both those beers?
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
I'm not easily shocked.
So?
No you're not.
What's the problem?
I thought I'd stay the night.
Is that all?
What's the worst thing you ever did?
It's not what you think.
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.
They seduce you?
Most people say the odds are against me.
All three -- in chronological order.
I love my brothers.
You're scared.
Neither am I.
What's this?
Don't do that.
Sneak up behind me like that.
She-hit.
Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
What's goin' on, Boss?
Lord Almighty.
I can't believe you let them do this!
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
I haven't worn mine in months.
Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
He's jammed the mechanism.
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...
It is insane.
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
No, Bud, no... not you.
Hello, Brigman.
We'll go in through that large breach.
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
Hey, you guys are milking that job.
Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...
He's convulsing!
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
Hippy, you pussy.
Are we talkin' little space friend here?
Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.
You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
1840... 50... 60... 70...
Figured that out for yourself, did you?
Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
Hey!
You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
4800 feet.  It's official.
He can still make it.
Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
But how could you say such a thing?
And have you any other truths to tell me?
This looks to me like a good sign. Don't you think so? As far as I'm concerned, anyone who reads the Bible could not have committed an act of impropriety. Why... as a matter of fact, I remember when I was in China, many years ago, I happened to be involved in a similar situation, concerning an English woman, the wife of Ambassador Shafford, a good friend of mine. There, too, we found a Bible... And I said at the time that whatever had happened, that clue alone had definitely ruled out the possibility of... suicide. Why, it was logical, I said, that whoever reads the Bible believes in God and therefore...  No? You don't believe it? Well, as a matter of fact, I was right... The woman was found two days later. It was a case of amnesia.
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
Claudia, listen to me...
What is it, Claudia?
Does it please you to say such things?
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
Claudia, let's get married?
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
Sandro ...What's the matter?
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
Good night, my love.
Have you ever been in love?
Who are you talking to?
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?
But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
Ettore...
You men are all so dreadful!
Why don't you try?
Whose boat is that?
Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...
Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
Did you manage to find good rooms?
Why have we stopped?
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
No.
Because...
It's a sin to be fat.
Look at the statues, they're thin.
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.
But she watches... she listens.
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
What do you mean?
Should you see a doctor?
You have a lovely voice.
Have you ever loved anyone?
Who?
Well, who in particular?
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
He's told you?
You've been alone together?
Yes.
Yes.
I... I don't understand.
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
Would you like some?
Why not?
Why do you smoke?
One.
What else did she tell you?
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
Did your mother see angels often?
Why not?
And you're unhappy.
What did you do?
Agnes. What did your mother do to you?  If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you?  Did she make you do something you didn't want to?  Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  Did it embarrass you?  Did it... did it hurt you?  What did she make you you do?
She can't hurt you any more.
Yes?
And that you're stupid?
That you're a mistake?
Oh, yes.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Are you pretty?
Agnes, you're stupid.
Who am I?
Of telling you.
What made it grow?  Do you know?
My bed.
Of what?
So I could go to him.
Stay away from me...
God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
It was dead.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Something they... that they overlooked.
Larry...
All I want is one more week.
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
I can beat that.
Is that normal?
How did she hide it during the day?
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
What's his name?
Could there have been anyone else?
Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
Who?
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
She has it now.
It's my affair too.
I'm only interested...
???  
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
Listening to angels?
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
For Agnes.
She's been touched by God, yes.
Somebody told her.
Hasn't she had enough?
Was it you?
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
For what?  An abortion?
Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
Oh, it's all right.
Shurrup!
You don't think...
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
Leave them drums alone.
Yeah, you know, "O.K. Buster, follow that car, there's a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!"
I see you go to the night court.
Are you going in?
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
Get him out of here!!
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
Did you look in here?
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!
I don't think that bit's right.
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
I see.  Do you like the play?
Thank you.
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
Yes.
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
Parading's better!
So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
And what's it all come to in the end?
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
What are you doing?
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
Come on let's get this coffee.
Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
Yeah ... so what?
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
Well, what are we waiting for?
What are you doing there?
How d'you reckon that one out?
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
Y'what?
No.
Paul, John, George - get at it.
Now get on with it.
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
Hello.
My eyes are lighter.
And my nose...
Is it?
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
He's betrayed the class.
Well, you stick to that story, son.
Down the ... er ...
Yeah, down the ... er ...
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
What is he?
Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
I got it.  Oh boy.
Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
Activate lifter quads.
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
It's... basalt.  Rock.
Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.
What is it?
Maybe we can get in by the top.
Can we come up?
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice?  The food storage room on one end --
Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
It's really on there tight.
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean.
It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.
So it's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out.
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
Where did it come from?
Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
Now we're in for it.
While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
The flamethrower!
I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.
I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
That must have been when he got it.
You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
This should do it.
Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
That way.
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
No, it's coming.
<u>What is it</u>?
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
How?
They're getting pretty close now.
Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
Yeah, okay. 
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you on my board.
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door.
What film?
I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
Where did the parasites come from?
These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.
Two down, four to go.
That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.
This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
That'll blow the ship up.
You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it.
Kill me...
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
Nice howitzer you've got there.
We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.
How many of them are there?
Give or take.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
De Vries?
One of 'em must have escaped.
Careful of that edging there...
What?  Where?
Is it still moving?
Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
And...?
There's still time to back-out.
Sorry.  Two green enabling buttons...
I've got a lot of thinking to do.  'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.
Six month stint on Datus.
Yeah.  Somebody won.
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
That's the wrong way!
Hurry it up.
Where'd you leave them?
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
How do you know my name?
And what is your name?
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
You're more than modest.
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
Also with the reluctant compliments of Max Fabian.
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
I still don't know what you're getting at. Right now I want to take my nap. It's important that I-
Champion to champion.
What do you mean by that?
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
I had to get in, to meet Margo! I had to say something, be somebody, make her like me!
You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of "Cora" - and you lied to me about it!
I don't suppose there's a drink left...
I'm tired. I want to go home.
Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.
Feeling better, my dear?
Answer me this. What makes a man become a producer?
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
She was magnificent.
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them.
Bill...
You've already met.
When? When are you going to do it?
Only in some ways. You're prettier...
Oh well...  ... look through the wigs, maybe it got caught-
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
I told her. I sounded off.
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
You're my girl, aren't you?
You in a hurry?
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
Happy birthday, darling...
Yeah... I will.
When I'm guest of honor?
Thank you.
The audition.
Addison-!
It's obvious you're not a woman.
Well, I am.
It's not nonsense.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
Bill...  ... where are you going? To find Eve?
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...
A cowboy.
With the paper to prove it.
Just wondered what?
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie.
You need new girdles.
Adorable. We now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop.
You don't like Eve, do you?
Why not?
She's loyal and efficient-
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
You probably won't believe me.
Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
I'm going to take you to Margo...
There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
I thought you'd forgotten about me.
I think she would cheer.
You won't forget it?
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.
You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt.  I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what I did or said-
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
Addison wants me to play it.
No, thank you.  Yes. I've seen every performance.
What - again?
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
Ain't it the truth?
She's just outside the door.
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
That little place just two hours form New York. It's on my list of things-I'll-never-understand. Like collecting shrunken Indian heads...
How far to the station?
What about Bill?
Coming?
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression...
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "Cora."
Well of all-
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
Who is it? What's it all about?
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
To you, too?
I shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind! Just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing?
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
That depends.
Call, what call?
"Liebestraum."
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
This is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib!
--it was fine the way it was--
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
--what do you think?--
We understand your problem--
--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
--The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin--
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
What would you have done?
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
--Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere--
Woodward?
You overslept?
--jeeeeeeesus--
--what time is it?
Morning or night?
Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.
Sorry.  Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
--you got more than one source?--
--no--
--if he did it or just said he did it, God knows.
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
I thought you had to get to Miami.
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
Something maybe big.
Then it's our asses, isn't it?
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
Just tell me his title.
We can't talk inside either?
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
--this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in--  --and I was kind of curious about your check.
The twenty-five thousand dollar one.  The one with your name on it.  In Bernard Barker's Florida account.  Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
Go on.
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
Your name, please.
The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel.
--who you got?--
Anything?
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
No, it was good.
I'll do it.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
Great evening, isn't it?
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
All right, I got some scotch.
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Just go!
Not bad, Chris.
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
Do I have to?
What?  No I'm not.
Why are you doing this?
Hi...
Uh...my dad's the manager.
So we're gonna be close next year?
You're missing the game for us?!
Oz, it's okay, I know.
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
...I've never tried it.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.
No comment.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Are you kidding?  No.
Fuck me!  Yes!
There's our man.
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
I have no idea.  Finch showers in a bathing suit.
Hey, where's Finch?
Please, God.  Let this be it.
Hey, minuteman.
Back out?  You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  You afraid or something?
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
Yes.  Seriously.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
Okay, I get it.
...excuse me?!
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
Shame on you!
Vicky, wait.
Like how?
Kevin?  Do you not love me?
But you don't love me.
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
You comfortable?
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
You called me to ask me how to get laid?
Just dial 976-Asshole.
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Hey.  I got another question for you.
Then she said -- she loves me.
Contact, dude.
I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
...Guess what?
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?
Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Our last game is this Saturday.
You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
Hanging is nice. Never goes out of style. What about hare-kare - a taste of the Orient? But no! You're in Paris! Try the Guillotine! There's one in the Louvre!
The key is don't look down.
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
Don't you want to change?
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
What makes you so sure this will work?
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
I hope they fucking fry us all.
Holy mother of God...
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
We don't both have to die.
Didn't even have to ask.
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Enculé d'Americain.
Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
Claude...?
Another step and he's dead!
Ha. Some wonder drug...
He was a good man. Now his wife is a widow.
What?
Andy...
"Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed."  These pictures are not just myth, Andy. The scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. This is the medieval version of a newspaper.
Because Gaston was after it.
It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
Claude.
He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
Why would he pick this one?
Shit. I feel sick.
Andy!
What did she say?
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
Saint Severin...
What were you showing her?
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
Are you running away?
You'll laugh.
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
Why do you want to go to Paris?
I'm going to stretch my legs
Forged papers! Now, what?!
You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
I'm sorry.
I'm so scared...
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear...
Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
Hurry up with those papers.
See? The Princess is under there ...
We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.
You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
We've been through this.
I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas.  Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal?
Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
The alarm clock.
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
Oh - you're an actress.
I, uh... well, you're not from New York, right?
Uh, you're driving a-
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
That's okay, you... we-we can walk to the curb from here.
You want your tennis stuff?
Your grammy!
Oh, you see an analyst?
Neat?
Fifteen years, huh?
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
I know.
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
Yeah?
Here, you want some?
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
You see, like you and I...
No, I'm not.
You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps... you get excited.
That's the key question.
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
How is it any different?
No, don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for?  You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
What are you doing?
Uh-uh-why?
Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.  Thank you.
Yeah.
I'm home!
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Will it change my life?
David! David! I can't believe this!
Oooh.
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
Oh, Jesus, really?
Yeah, but it's real close.
You were-you were sensational. I mean, I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, I-I-you- you were sensational.
Remember, we had that thing.
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
God, it's so clean out here.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Yeah, this place is great.
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
You look very pretty.
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
Here you are. There's people out there.
Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
What-
It's like Samuel Beckett, you know- I admire the technique but he doesn't... he doesn't hit me on a gut level.
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
Oh.
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
Charlie Chaplin.
What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
I have some very good memories there.
We do the show live in front of an audience.
You all right?
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
The one with the V.P.L.
There are no twos, Max.
And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.
If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max.
Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
You fired the cleaning woman?
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.
Now, don't let it be so long, now.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
Oh, yeah, really, oh!
No, no, no, not at all.
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
Like you didn't know.  Who invited the bimbo?
Had a little help?
It has your ring.
What's that?
It's going.  It's going.
Isn't Skye amazing?
She's a constant surprise.
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
The movie.
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
Honey?
Why didn't you bring him?
Oh.
I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
You look so well, Clair.  A wraith.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
He's gonna miss his flight.
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
But she's alright.
You need to call your dad.
Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!!
Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?
Are you my big hard hero?
I'm fine, babe.
Not millions.
Whatever you say.
Scout's honor.
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
Otis!  No barking!
In the kitchen.
Two minutes.
There are fucking coyotes out there.
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
Happy anniversary.
Coffee?
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
Oh.  Well.  Good.
Yes I did.
Ah.
You got your DP?
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
A little out of my element.
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
And Ryan works at home.
Scout's honor.
Would you sign it for me.  I'm sure this is inappropriate.
I'm a little in the puke zone.
Lemon or raspberry?
Yes.
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
How do you do, Skye?
Jesus Christ.
I love it here.  Don't you love it here, Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love tonight.  And I love these people.  And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan.  Utterly fantastic.
Do you want to go home, Ryan?
Are you making an ass of yourself?
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
I...
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
That was my clue.
Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Will champagne help?
Panes is here!
She's all over him, are you blind?
How?
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
Everyday.
Shit!
You're a shit.
Like Joe.
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
Nevermind.
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Tell me about it.
Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
Really?
You're right!
And you are...?
No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
Out here I'm just what?
Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
And only you can become a Queen?
We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
Come on, Z.
Of course --
Barbatus!
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No <u>single</u> ant matters, right?
...Not enough food?
What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one.
Not there.  Under the mat.
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
Sure.
You mean tonight?
I wasn't trying to be personal -- it's just that the fellows in the office were -- whether you wondering about you ever --
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
Well, don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix. They may get the wrong idea how you found out.  'Bye.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
One more?
Here.
What is it?
Who?
What's her first name?
Something wrong with your legs?
But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
I think I'm going to give it all up.
Cut.
No doubt about it.
What for?
Why not?
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Who was that?
There's a call for you --
Are you all right?
You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.
Are we dressing for dinner?
I see you bought some napkins.
You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked among eight million people. Then one day I saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were --  It's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two.
How's everything at the apartment?
Yes.  You walking to the subway?
Are you all right?
Mind if I come in?
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
Last night?
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
How do you work it with the key?
Where are you going, Baxter?
How would you like to go tonight?
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
Hello? -- yes -- what's on your mind, Baxter?
You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
Sir?
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
I see.
Don't mind what?
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
What's gotten into you, Baxter?
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
You threatening me?
Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
She going to be all right, Doc?
Hello, Miss Kubelik.
You like Castro?  I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
That so.
Still stuck on her, huh.
No kidding.
Not so rough, honey.
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
Here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in Havana.
I see.  What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
Dreyfuss.
Do you know where you are, Fran?
Do you know who this is?  Look at him.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's right.
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
I don't believe you.
I want you back, Fran.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
That's enough, Fran.
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
I have that date -- remember?
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
Coming?
Are you there, Fran?
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to nine!
Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
Where does she live?
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
You came in on that boat, didn't you?
Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
No -- absolutely not --
Moonby what?
Winning the war by yourself.
Which part is that ?
That's good gin.
North ?
Rangers, eh?
How long were you up there ?
Holy shit.
Why they call you that?
A sauciere --
This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here.
Can I go get those mangos now?
What'd he say?
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
Will they attack?
Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river.
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
What do you want ?
You didn't like him.
You got a chance in that boat -- by morning you could be five miles down the river.
Who is he?
How did they know?
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Yeah.
I thought he was a lame.
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
We don't want to bother you any, we --
We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that.
They far enough?
What do you mean?
How big it is?
Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees.
Can you trust them?
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one.
Fucking savages.
You know, some day this war's gonna end..
Why did you come to ... my province.
Do you know me?
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
Sounds like he's gone crazy.
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
What's a big question?
Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
What if I say no.
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
Well who the hell verifies that ?

See the blood?  Pack of wolves took down a moose.  Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.

Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
My dad was a Navy doctor.
You should know something.
Be careful, okay?
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
I'm not gonna carry you out of here.
Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?
Be my guest.
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
There's a cabin, maybe twenty miles south of here.
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
What do you know about people? You live like an animal!  A savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here, as far away from the rest of us as possible.
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
Emergency transmitter?  What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
Look down there, tell me what any of this matters.  Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. Soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.
Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
All this for laying traps on private land?
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
I need to rent a cabin.
If Corbett's men find out --
You don't care enough about Sam to --
Neff, you know better than this...
What'd you say they call these spaceships?
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
You hear me?  Ben?
There's what they're waiting on!
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
I'm sorry.
He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
How long has he been having problems?
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
I'm starving.
He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
No... no thank you notes.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
And?
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
How you doing?
Cute.
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
Boyfriend?
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
Well...
Can you not be violent?
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
No touch. No touch. No touch.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
How you doing, great one?
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
I carry bacon in my pocket.
Would you leave now, please?
I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
What are you talking about? You got real problems.
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
What did she say?
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
Exactly what is your previous experience?
So you're practically finished, huh?
Uh, Fontella's
Not too good at small talk, eh?
No shit.
What are you doing?
You can't --
Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over!
Five million dollars?
Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
I'm on the scent.
No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.
What?
Who?
How did he know?
Hello, Robert.
I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit! Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking gone!
Um, five.
Twenty large?  That's all?
You want me to pump?
An assassin?
Someone hired both of you?
Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
Had?
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
More or less.
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
No, they didn't.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
Women?  No... not really.
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Because you are a women.
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
Good.
But you've never figured out a way to win.
What do you think he's doing?
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
That's right.
What?
I told you, he will.
They're worth less points.
That's a ridiculous move.
Can I ask you something?
Yes.
Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
Did you --
Were you attracted to me right away?
That doesn't sound normal.
Four minutes.
Electra --
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
I prefer it like this.
Why are you working today?
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
For what?
Do you ever regret things you've done?
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
Do you ever think about starting over?
How much farther?
You're pretty famous aren't you?
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
Right.
Can I ask you a question?
Why didn't you fade?
Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?
Of course, senor.
I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.
So how's your work?
How to make a buck!
Because it's in English?
You guys having a go a me or what?
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
No, I got nothing till Tuesday.
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.
Tell them we're working for the University.
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
I don't know but that used to be a window and I think that was a door.
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
Need any disks?
Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
Like helping a sick kid?
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
Let's split.
Afternoon!
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
Here, let's both put in two hundred crowns. That should get nine or ten bottles of wine.
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
Huh?
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
You know, there is one thing I can't figure out. All along they've been bugging me about those files and when I told them I'd burned all that stuff, they went nuts - they told the Consul guy they were medical records?
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
And if you're wrong.
What do you want me to do?
Doug, I can't just leave you!
If I cut a deal, I'm not staying in this country and I want Holly to come with me. So, if she doesn't come here today, you're going to have to get her to me tomorrow; after I call, promise?
God, I think I need a holiday.
What about me?
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
Yeah, pretty well.
Take this exit.
Jesus Holly, we got enough time.
It's that one isn't it.
I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out, well not this time, I'm sorry.
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
Before you go, did you get those bruises here?
I've been around.
We should be done by the weekend.
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
She's tired.
Beer please! Do you want another drink?
I could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but I waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs.
I thought for sure they would catch me.
It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
You mean you don't know, Henry! We got a bunch of anarchists, controlling a six-level block of luxury apartments down on Janovska street here in the Old Town, and you don't know about it?
Will this thing take long?
I thought I'd help out.
Seems a shame!
Why are you doing all this, what for?
What's the Bugler?
I'd better get you to a hospital.
Run into Josh?
Why don't we both forget about him?
Where did you steal the car?
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.
You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.
We had a deal!
Hey Doug, where you been?
Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?
It's more than what you're worth.
So, who is in the building?
It was crazy not to have destroyed them
So go dance.
She asleep?
What if they expel you?
Why not?
Your father dropped off an extra check.
You look nice. I should have dressed.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
Were you with Jamie?
You do. You're handsome and charming.
I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing?
Don't call him a dipshit.
Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
I know you don't want help.
Yeah.
I'll take a chance.
Like you'd know.
Because I try to be nice to people?
He doesn't trust you.
The play's going to be really good.
He okay?
You were great the other night.
I haven't been nice to you.
I don't want to be just your friend --
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
Is there a rush?
It's only 7:30.
It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.
What do you actually know with religion?
I don't understand...
Are you trying to seduce me?
Here. Why am I looking at this star?
What are you going to -- ?
How're you doing?
Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
I care for her.
We didn't tell him any different for years --
You've been well?
Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
Now I can do what I want.
For the inner satisfaction it will bring.  Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself.  Some of us remember how your father --
For Jefferson High. For books.
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
So what did we just make?
Morning Dick.
What's N.R.C.?
How was school today?
Learn anything?
Here's your jacket!
It's polyester.
Huh?
Hi, Marty.
Well, Eileen...jeez, that's hard for me to say. Have you ever been in a situation where -- well -- you know you have to act a certain way, but when you get there, you don't know if you can go through with it?
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
You've gotta ask her to the dance!
What do I say?
Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
Your line, George!
Maybe if I used my left....
Yeah, explode it up your ass!
Who, me?
Sir, it only costs a nickel.
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
March 11th.
Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.
What?!
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
Pro, the sun's out!
Catch you later! 
The plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?
Pardon me?
Say, where did this guitar come from?
Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
My guess is that she turned him down.
That's all taken care of.
That's just what I needed to hear.
Hop in, Marty, . We've got a long drive ahead of us.
What theater was I at?
Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.
What happened to Dick Wilson?
Suzy!
Hi. where's Cato?
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
What you been doing?
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
What do you feed him?
You lost that one?
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir.  That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.
That's my father. I got to run.
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
You're a redhead.
Somebody else is going to get it.
I came in the front.
I can look and see.
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
How you doing?
Is he upset?
No.
What?
Have you got a better idea?
Course it's too bad about your dad.
What's that?
Hi, whatcha doing?
You didn't walk out here.
Hi.
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
Planet 10?
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
You're a welcome sight...
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
And they got Penny!  Look!
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
You.  Like the papers all say.
Was she pretty?
How did she die?  I wanna know.
Never.
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
Not too terrific, sir.  I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire.
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
Not here!  No Overthruster!
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.
Any sign of Buckaroo?
I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
I see.
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his –
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
Hello, Barton.
Yes, I'm afraid I have.
Before what?
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
...This'll sometimes help.
How d'ya like your room!
Could you come back later?  It's just...  too hot... My head is killing me.
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent – don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the –
...Huh? No, I'm –
...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
Wuddya got for me – what the hell happened to your face?
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps – this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
...That's fine.
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
...Is the egg showing or what?!
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
...I don't guess this means much to you.
...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
Thanks, I'd invite you over to my place, but it's a goddamn mess. You married, Bart?
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
You'll be back?
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik –
Yeah... rye whiskey?
...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help –
Yes sir.
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
Charlie... Charlie's back...
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
We got a treatment on it yet?
...Maybe we should do a treatment.
Mr. Lipnik, I –
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.
There's no smoking in this building.
Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him?  I'd have to be really dumb to do that.
We got a call from Berkeley P.D. There was a killing.  A professor. Icepick.  In his bed.  Multiple stab wounds.  1977.
I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here.
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
Who?
What is this interest you've got in her?
I had him in two classes.
What are you doing here?
Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?
How long were you dating him?
Do you have a cigarette?
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
I told you -- I quit.
But you said you liked men to use their hands.
How did you feel when he died?
I'm tired.
How do you know all this stuff about me?
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.
Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"
When did you write it?
Yes.
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
Why take the risk?
How's your new book?
I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me.  I'm going down to Johnny's club.
How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to the century, too?
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
About three months before I met you.
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
Do you believe me?
What did he say?
You like to hang out with murderers or what?  Did you know Roxy --
You still think I kill people, don't you?
I'm writing a book.
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
Did you ever tie him up?
I don't really feel like talking anymore.
You workin' on another book?
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
Nope, can't say that I do.
Was she ever a suspect?
What kind of talk?
Thanks.
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
You think I --
I'm not afraid of her.
You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you?
Maybe the maid did it.
What was the motive?
He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  That's the last time anybody saw him.
I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.
Who are you?
Yes I did.
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
Is this finished yet?
Naa..
Saddle River, New York!
Yeah... Like – stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery.
What's with the wigs?
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!
Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
MOTHAFUCKAH!
... Can you... decipher this for us?
Yes, I understand – but where do you take them from?
What are they?
Yeah.
Paint it out.
It's Andy again.
– In this corner?
You want me to put it here?
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
Hey – Willie Mays.
Who am I?
"She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby!
I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here – I made this for you.
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
No, don't tell me – you just got fired by your crazy boss.
Wanna go get some breakfast?
I'm your family.
... babies.
Hi.
What's that?
Is that the best quality you have?
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
Come on.
What? What do you want?
Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts – you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
So keep painting.
'Phillips head,' right?
Uh-oh!
Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
Where's the fire?
Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
Didn't I say that?
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
Not compared to that "Cobblepot" person you're promoting...
I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
Me, domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it!  You repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.
I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
Ten, nine...
Well, um... funny thing, your penguins... they're not responding to the launch command.  Fact they're kind of turned around now... Like someone jammed our signal...
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
Wonder if it's worth my time.
Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
Morning, Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?
Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -
I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in.  And...
I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
I'm sorry.  I was too late.
He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.
You have?
But I can't can I?
Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
I love you, old man.
Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now.
Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
Pow!  What!  Kazow!
Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.
Nice suit.  And today you are?
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
If we could relay the sunlight-
They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?
And?
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
That's gotta hurt.
He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
No gun.  How disarming.
You will rescue my wife
Make yourself right at home.
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
You're too late.  Say bye-bye birdie.
Join you?  I've spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction and now you corrupt my research into some maniacal scheme for world domination. When I get through you won't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry, do you hear me, you psycho?
...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
Why do I keep doing this?
How are you feeling, young man?
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
...Afraid.
...A bat.
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
Now black rubber.
Help Chase. I'll be back.
Fast work. You just moved here.
Why do you do that?
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred?
That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
No.  Wait...
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.
Not until you do that thing I like.  On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie...  Woah. Harsh toke.
Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy.
How high up would you say that is?
Look! Police!
Please.
... How long have I been out?
What is that?
Great.  Give me a grant.
That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
Do you want a drink?
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
Got it!
We got 'em!
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
Boss! Jesus! They've --
Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --
Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
Man, I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
Yum, yum.
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Yep.  He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop?  Jim Gordon
Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
Yeeees?
And what did you say?
It isn't working any more, David.
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
Let's get a coffee.
He doesn't like to say much does he?
Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
Big day today, huh? 78
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
What happened?!!!
Howls he getting on with the family?
And howls Alison?
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
Everything okay, David?
He's just parking the Governor's car.
Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!
So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
No!
Thank you David.  However, flattery will get you nowhere.  Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama.  Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...
Brilliant, huh?  I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  Spread the news.  I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
I think you're wrong, David.  She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
Of course.
Welsh.
... in the distant future.
Doctor Jacobson?
I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two.  Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen!  I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
Ow! These chips suck.
Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
Shut up, dill-hole.
Turd-burglar...
Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
They look like a couple of kids chief.
You see what I see, Bork?
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
Not on him, Chief.
Chief, look!
One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
Whoa, this kicks ass! Huh huh huh.
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
You got two seconds!
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
You'll be rich!
Manchurian Tung oil?  Where did you get it?
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
That little girl saw us.
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
What about this Beetle guy?
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
But <u>we</u> let him out.
And your sushi was remarkable.
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
Aren't you scared?
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
What is going on?
Did you get the paint?
Help vouchers?
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
<u>Barbara</u>?!!
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
Just get some people out of our house.
-- Like you used to be?
No.
If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?
God, you're anatomically correct!
Can you help <u>me</u>?
Otho?
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>.  Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
They're probably guilty about what they did to me.
Where is your mother?
I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
Not <u>a building</u>!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't know the value of their property!
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...
What's happening to them?
Is this the key to the attic?
Otho, that's terrible.
Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.
Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
... He walked off...
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
Oh. I have a message for him.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Would you care for a drink?
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
Chauncey!
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.
... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often?
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
Bravo!
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
Certainly, Ben.
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
Some pictures...?
I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
Please, sir.
... My suitcase.
How long do we stay in here?
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
No headaches?
Do you feel well enough for that?
I'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached...  ... And so are you, aren't you, Eve.
... Ben, really...
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
... Would you take me on a tour?
... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
This is not what I requested.
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.
John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
Morning.
Did you eat?
I was worried.
I have to go back now.
How was it?
And he was with her.
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
The monkey.
I know.
Mr. Juarez?
Security.
You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
Moving story.
Why not?
What'll you have?
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
No, wait! I like your tits.  I love your tits. I want to fuck you.
So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
Tickets to Malkovich?
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
Let him try.
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
You can be John Malkovich.
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Forget it.
Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
Ah.
Yeah, I saw them
Can I get you a drink?
Thanks so much for coming over.
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
Stay in him forever?
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
You've got to be kidding.
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
Captain Mertin?
You got to go sometime. You got to go out there by yourself sometime.
Folks came.
We have to be steady. "These things too will pass". What you looking for? A miracle?
They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long.
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
You on your way home?
You think she sure 'nough your sister?
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
Yes?
What you want?
You know what? I've been here since I was fourteen and I remember like yesterday when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat right where you are. Whiteman name of Garner brought her. He and Mr. Bodwin were good friends. That's how she got that house you all live in. Other things too.
Won't you be late for work?
MAMA!
True.
Can't locate him.
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
Sethe?
No, You looking good.
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Fuck.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw?
Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
Her life is in your hands.
That had not occurred to us, Dude.
I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I want Bill Kunstler.
Uh-huh.
A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Fuck, man!  That's terrible!
There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom is.  Those are the fucking rules.
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR MONEY!
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
What the fuck is he talking about?
His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude!
What do you mean, Dude?
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
Almost five!
Burkhalter.
It's already posted.
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
Am I wrong?
Those are good burgers, Walter.
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
1972 Pontiac LeBaron.
Take it easy, Dude.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
This is quite a pad you got here, man.  Completely unspoiled.
Which one was Logjammin'?
Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved?
Is that what that's a picture of?
Excuse me?
You mean coitus?
Well--sure, I could do that--
A hundred.
Yeah, but what about--
And please don't call her my mother.
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects.
What happened to your house?
Finder's fee?
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
So who--
Yeah, but--
Donny!  Please!
Theodore Herzel.
Hey man--
Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.
Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.
Oh shit.  Walter.
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
...Huh?
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
Walter!
Walter--
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
That makes me feel all warm inside.
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
Uh-huh.
Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money!
Is this your homework, Larry?
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency.  I'm not--
Huh?
Walter, come off it.  You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
This driveway.
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
Call the medics, Dude.
You make everything a fucking travesty!
What about that shit about Vietnam!
Shut the fuck up.  Hello?
Dude.
Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man?
Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?
You monsters!
Shit, sorry man.
Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle.
Whatta we do about the Mex?
What was that?
What about Nomak?
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
What do you really think?
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
Where were you, Whistler?
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
You want me to hunt them for you.
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
Nomak?
Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
We want to attract them, not scare them off.
What the fuck you doing?
From his father, of course.
Any casualties?
An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was not among them, I trust.
Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
Whistler!
Stupidity.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
Is something wrong, my friend?
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
I am tired. Dawn is coming.
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
What are you doing?!
You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.
What is this place?
What am I injecting you with?
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
Just get out of here.
You don't look so good.
Is it bad?
Get out of here --
You don't have to be.
This isn't human blood.
The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".
The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
The shadows suit us, Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways?
How do you like that? Right on time.
You're a monster.
Blade --
Who are you people?
So what do you use, then? A stake?
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
--and if she ever did--
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
Try, please, Anna--
What do you mean?
Domini?
Inside the grave?
--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
Druid Hill Park.
Cheery little place.
So says her website.
Jesus.
--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
Anna--
Baby names?
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
--now c'mon!
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
Just now?
Just...try and go back to sleep.
I want to see something!
Are you marked like this??
--hours before--
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
Beer and weed is what I've got.
So, I hear you're from New Mexico!
I don't think it was them.
This is a little nuts.
You're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you?
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
No fucking.
What're you, crazy??
English.
Be it still alive, James?
I'd strongly advise you to join us--
--f'chrissake, Heather, it's not like the two of us are gonna doze off he leaves for two seconds--
You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?
Was it <u>every</u> day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid?
Okay, but--
How're the cameras doing?
There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--
What--
Well, she's got to be <u>somewhere</u> here.
Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?
Just hold on!
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.
Pointless.
Women miscarry all the--
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
--bullshit--
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
There's explanations. Rational explanations for everything that's happened. We'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.
Spare me.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
Your mother's pastor.
...For you I answer the door. If you wanna stay here, that's fine. But I'm retired.
Why d'you wanna leave all this?
Who was it?
...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.
I could've sworn I heard something.
...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
Uh-huh.
...What?
...You called me this morning.
What happened?--Was Meurice there?
...What's going on with you two?
Then what'd you come here for?
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
If the pay's right I'll do it.
I'm supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why should I trust you?
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?
...it's too damn risky.
That's not the point.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
Tuesday is ladies' night.
Jeffrey. you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Frank. Come in.
To your health, Frank.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Jeffrey! Come on in.
Okay?
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Hello, baby.
Who's this fuck?
He's comin' back?. What for?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
That oughta do it.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
Yes.
Hi. can I come in?
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
It used to make me laugh .but.
I asked first.
I'm glad you do.
Yes.
What?
Yeah, it's me.
Shh. I'll tell you.
Heineken.
Hey? . You like to walk.
What are you lookin' at?
Oh yeah?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
What's the plan.
Brilliant.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Okay. be careful.
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Really?
My father has a gun at home.
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
What?
God. you scared me.
Nothing. I'm fine.
No. you're right.
He comes over to study.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
Tuna, this is crap.
You can't sell this to your friends.
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
The coca is my responsibility!
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
What the fuck is that?
What the fuck is that?
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
You?
I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.
George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
What kind of project?
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
No, my brother.
Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?
What type of planes do you have?
How are we doing?
Please, continue.
Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
There's no room.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
Three years.  How long have we been in business?  Three years.  Does she get to meet your connection?  Was she good enough?
Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
Yeah.  Nice.
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?
I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.
What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
I want money.
Yeah, maybe.
I'm sorry, George.
What are you going to do?
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
Just low.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
...you sonofabitch.  Putting on George's boots.
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.
Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him. We've got him dead to rights.  But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.
Figured it out.
George.
Do I know you?
Why are you smiling?
Where are you going?
There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.
She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas.
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
I don't know.
What?
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
I swear.  On my life.
I didn't mean to...
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
Because she's visiting me.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.
Yeah?
Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
Holy shit, Dulli!
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...
Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...
Second name.
Second district ... Explain better ...
Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
Can you read?
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
To show them to the UN, right?
Good evening ... Can we pass?
But it's not even midnight yet!
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting.  I followed her today to an attorney's office. Joseph Koehler.
Take some time off.
You did a good job, Charlie.
I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces of sperm on the sheets.  The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.
That's what my report will read.
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
What induced it?
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
I've got work to do.
What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here.  This has become personal to you.
That's ridiculous.
You've been following me?
Objection.  The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness.
Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
Her name?
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
Tell the court about that, please.
How did he look?
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
Is it Marsh?
She was here?
How long were you together?
Can you give the court an example?
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
-- And what did you suggest?
Yes.
You'll be sorry?
I'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
Why does she come to you?
October twenty-seventh.
Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?
I heard him say it.
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
Did he make your life miserable?
You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you?
How do you know that?
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
Yes.
And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?
Dristan nasal spray.
P.M.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler in the first place?
Yes.
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
He'll file.  He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion -- such savage emotion.  They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other.  Not really.
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
Hello?
Hi, Frank.
Yes -- she did.
Yes -- it would be nice.
You lied to me!
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
Something wrong?
You don't need anybody.
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
Michael -- get off the phone.
Because I'm expecting a call.
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
Can't it wait?
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point?
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
Well, that's a long time.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
It's a beautiful picture of her.
Eeeww!
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
What are you doing?
He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.
Then why do you?
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
Not yet. You want to go?
Not this kind of heat.
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
Pretty country.
Oh. When did you move back?
Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.
Oh, that's nice.
Mind if I smoke?
Where are you staying while you're here?
Feeling better?
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
Help cook?
You ought to write these stories down.
You sound like an artist.
Do you miss it?
My God. How I'd love to see that.
Well, it's kind of buggy out there.
You drink bug repellent?
When?
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
So what happened?
You must get lonely at times.
Woman friends, too?
You really don't need anyone?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
But no one in particular.
My mistake. I apologize.
Listen, I'm sorry I --
Francesca?
Am I interrupting anything?
I would love to come for dinner.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
Yeah?
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling.
Why do you say that?
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
Am I too heavy for you?
I... What do you want?
STOP IT!
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
Where you going?
Now?!  It's after eleven.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."
I'm positive.
Betty.
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
We can't go back there.  Are you crazy? You saw --
Died there?  How?
Hey, kid.
Bones!  How baddass is zat?  This is the place for us.  Patrick, you get platinum props, man.  Platinum.
Are you nuts?
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
You think that's really him?
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
What else?  Money.
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
I said, no thanks.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
Jimmy, you've got --
It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
Sorry, my brother.
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
Have you ever been inside?
It's alright, baby.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
We'll have to sneak in.
Lucky thing.
The dead get out?
And you believe her?
Cinn?
I can't.  Not yet.
Patrick, he's...
Where is it?
Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it.  Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't shitting you.
Where are we going?  You know I hate surprises.
Please...help me...
Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please, help me...
You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.
That's all we did, steal their ride.
And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.
Yeah right, and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all Vincent Price's cash.
Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  Last time I checked, you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the hell you are.  But I know you aren't a black man.
"Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool.
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
Not really to live, just to play.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
... see there ain't just two parts to a person.  There's three.  Body-Soul and Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in the house.
Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.
Come on, Pop, all I want to know is one thing.  Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it.  I bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it, Caesar?
How the fuck can I open it?
Caesar?  What is this?
No, Gino!
Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.
Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit!
Violet, please!
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
Tell them!  Tell them!
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
You murdered Gino!
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
What?  How about a drink?
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
You got the key?
Call me as soon as you get him.
Hello?
Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
Oh, I'm sorry --
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
Truck.
I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...
Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
What are you afraid of?
No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman.
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it.
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
You said he washed the money?
What?
It's in a case, on his desk.
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Gino Marzzone.
Does Johnnie hit on you?
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
Where will you be?
I'm just asking, what if?
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
Hey.
I know you will.
Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
Forget it.
We don't know what we're into!
I'm going to Paris.
What do you mean?
Yes.
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
Keep it. 
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
We're about an hour away.
You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
Where?
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
-- just --
-- let me do this, okay? --
He's dead isn't he?
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
Oh, Jesus...
But the police --
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.
Is this it? --  -- this is it, right? --
He run away often?
Get in the basement.
xxxxxx...
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
What?
Tell him we're busy.
You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.
Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer.  Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?
...ervices.
... And then some.
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
Sign here, please.
Er ... Thanks ...
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Please, I've got to find Jill.
Hello, Jack!
How much do you know?
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
Jack?... Jack?
Stamped?
But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
I bet you'd like to touch them?
Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer -  DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them! 
Where are you taking me?
What's going on here?
It's heavy.
Why don't you say, no system is perfect.
Look at that - right on time.
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!
We? Don't blame me!
Shit! The house is on fire!
What?
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
What a relief! I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted.
But if they did promote you
He is dead.
There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am.
Damn! Blast!
I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
Lime, I need to use your computer
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
Numero une, crevettes à la mayonaaise. 
I just wish you would stop interfering, mother! I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am.
Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval.
Mother? Is that you?
Is Mr Helpmann here?
What have you done with his body?
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
A steak, please. Rare.  Mother, I need to ...
I don't know which numero.
what? ... Oh ... 
What?
A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
The pace?
Are you expecting anyone?
Thank you very much. How much will it...?
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
Hey Cy, guess who's here?
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
Where is she?
Does that hurt?
IB Bangin.
Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.
Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed.
He's very very sick.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
He's dead, huh?
He's better, isn't he?
Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
Promise you won't go inside.
You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me?
Who is it?
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
Don't give me that look.
I hate vodka.
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
Would you like to come in?
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
The brakes are shot.
Do it!
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
You're in the stomach!
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
What did I do to you?
You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world.  It's unseemly.
Shut up a second...
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
Yes.
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
You were smokin' toward the end there.
Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
No.  Don't worry about it.
You know what I...
Hi.
He excels at gratitude.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Eventually rising to...
He must have been great-looking, right?
Okay.  Let's do me.
Nine seconds.
I write for you sometimes.
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.
How'd it go?
Did it really go well?
Do you feel good about it?
Then what was good about it?
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
Aaach...Jane...  Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me.  Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you.  You know?
I think you're the Devil.
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
So who's the guy?
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
It's what he did.  I'm proud of him.
The cost-efficient reporter.
I was a little nervous there for a minute.
Goodbye, Paul.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
It's Aaron.
Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
Because...
No...no.
What?
Yes.  How do you know?
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
Anchor?
Good.  He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
Bye, sweetie.
You don't have to finish tonight.
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
As long as that's your only problem you're...
I had no idea she was this good.
Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say...
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
They said it would be okay if...
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Nervous?
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
It's not important.
So what did you think?
Uh-huh.
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
I got promoted for things like that.
I don't wan to discuss work.
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
What are you doing here?
Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
That doesn't look like very much clay.
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
Let's see it.
Hi Walter.
Oh yeah?
More champagne, your majesty?
I like you very much, Walter.
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
Walter...stay away from me!
That's word for word.
You've arrived.  You've been recognized.  You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.
Are you trying to be funny?
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
I wonder what his deal is.
There's that weird dude again.
What did he say?
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
Walter, what are you doing?
Well I brought something, I wanted to show you.
You...made that?
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
You know what that proves?
Well...why murdered man?
A show?!  Like this Sunday?
What do you have in the box?
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
Did you see my cat?
Police officer.
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
Are you done with these?
I saw your...cat.
And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?
Why on Earth should you be so depressed?  Have you heard some of the things they've been saying? You can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
Oh, OK.
I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!
What's wrong with you!?!
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
Buffy!  Looking tasty.
Figures.
Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
I'm fine.
I'm hungry.
Wheels?
Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Buffy, honey?
You okay?
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
What'd you dream about?
Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.
You want some water or something?
Where are you gonna go?
I didn't expect to see you.
Who?
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
Can't.  History report.  The Normans and the Saxons.
Let's meet tonight, okay?
I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
Excuse me for having something important to do.
Why?
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
Time to do what?
I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
None of your business.  God.
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
Why do you keep saying that?
What?
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
Here?
No -- you don't have to --
Oh.  Sorry.
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Same one.
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
Interesting.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
The mark of the Coven.
Write that down.
Oh, yes!  Yes!
She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom.
I can't believe they still ate it.
And Spring Fling.
She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
Omniplex?
Environment.  That's cool with me.
Oh, yeah!
Buffy, the ape-woman.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
You said "Crash".
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
Just till I lose.
No.
I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
That's my leg.
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
He did?
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
I'm Crash Davis.
After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
Don't tell anybody.
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
I don't know if I'd go that far.
It's possible.
I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.
You think I could make it to the Show as a manager?
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
Ninety-five miles an hour.
Ninety-three miles an hour.
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
Good--then listen.  "I sing the body electric.  The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them--"
No, that is not belief.  That is desperation.
I didn't spit on you!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
What do I got?
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
What do I gotta do?
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
What's wrong?
I'm trying to thank you.
I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this--
You're a great catcher.
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
Nuke--  Good luck.
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
She's playing with my mind.
No.
Well tell 'em, honey.
Where's Ebby?
He's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head.
You guys lollygag the ball around the infield, ya lollygag you're- way to first, ya lollygag in an' outta the dugout.  You know what that makes ya  Lollygaggers.  What's our record, Larry?
Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't look loose.  Anything bothering him?
Crash ain't there.  He never gets back till four or five--
Look at yours.
That's right.
You were wandering around.
You were in the m- You were in the building.
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind.
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
...been right, but who knows?
No, you're not calm.
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing.
Okay.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
Mommy.
When did this happen, honey?
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.
...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.
Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him.
Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
In other words, I'm fucked.
Hello.
Hey, Ace.
You think he got the point?
All right, fine.
...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
You lost your control.
Listen, I would -
Okay?
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.
...hundred yards further down the road.
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
I just told you. She called me.
I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Hello.
Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?
How'd you know I was here?
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
Seven o'clock?
Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.
Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
It's always been our policy -
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
This woman's an institution.
Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.
What, are you trying to handicap me?
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
Why're you crying?
You're with me now.
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Hi. Nice to see you.
Oh, fabulous.
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
You can't make me stop caring...
Listen.  Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -
If not for me, at least for Amy.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
Hello.
...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you where you are, just please, put Amy on a plane. Just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away...
...the rest of the two million is still there?
So, what'd ya do with it?
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
Yeah.
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
Oscar wants you to call him.
With Jennifer.
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
I wouldn't -
Now you need approval from him to go home?
If she calms down, I will let her in the house.
...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
- you could put 'em on your expense account?
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
It won't happen again, Sam.
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.
We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.
No.
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.  Get the fuck out of here.
I don't want to go to Europe.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.
Can I go in?
Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you could just ask the guy for a big bag, okay?
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
Hey, Mr Rothstein, it'll make it a lot easier on everybody here if we just let her in the house.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Leave me alone!
You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
He's comin' over.
He's not here?
We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
Hey, Frankie.
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that?
Of course, Remo.
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
Fine.
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.
I can see that. Sure.
Listen, Ginger... you know, this is probably not... I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with Ace.
He gives a fuck what I do?
Okay.
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -
Let me think about that.
No, he's not.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
Yes!
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
Well, how 'bout that?
I'm here.
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.
They checked in alone.
Excuse me, but I folded these things beautifully and I would appreciate a little respect. Jesus Christ!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Smarten up.
Come here, come here.
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
This is Nick.
...Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Mm.
They're havin' a good time too.
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
My fuckin' head.
Hey! Oh!
Again!
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
I know, but that's enough.
Take it easy, though.
Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...
You say that like an amnesia victim.
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...
I'm sorry I went off like that, I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten.  When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?
This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
I better go report this in...
Selina, are you okay?
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes, twice for..
Catwomen. Lots of them!
I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing?
Yeah, this is better than rape.
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
Car wash, Captain?
Well, we spent enough time building the damn thing, might as well use it.
Why are you--I fought for you with honor.  Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior.
You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
Hello, Spooky.
"Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
I don't know what came over me.
Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
How much?
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Did you try to kill...
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could...
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
I don't know if I can do it alone.
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
You seem sad, Spooky.
Any place.
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
Now that'd be a misdemeanor.
What's this?
Yeah, I suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die.  Particularly if you're not expecting it.  You don't know what hit you.
He's seen both of us now.
That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  I heard you were a hitter.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
I thought you said you could handle him.
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
Do I know you?
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
Oh won't I?
Don't lay this on me!
Why would anybody want to hurt you?
Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
Please.
He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.
Tell me what she looks like.
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
Does she wear glasses?
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
What bank?
What did you do?
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
Now I have -- it's a long story.
He had a gun.  I have it now.
Who's in back?
Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
What's that supposed to me?
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
He wants 75 back.
What's Nels' number?
What's happening?
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
What's really on your wicked little mind?
Naturally.
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
Know what else is in here?
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
They saw you kill the driver.
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
I'm here.  Where are you?
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
Who am I talking to?
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
You researched me.  You know where I live.  She'll be waiting for you there along with your split.
Yeah?
We're gonna get there first.
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
Since when did you guys start changing tires?
So let's call this the usual.
He's what she should run a mile from.
Saw that one.
Jimmy.
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
No, of course not, she's a lady.
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
Someone recommend you?
You American?
And what's it like?
What was that?
Perform?
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
You want to know how I kissed him?
Are you jealous of him?
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
Come on, Dil --
Made me feel all funny inside.
I didn't mean to hit you.
So I'm sorry.
Will you meet me again?
Don't.
There's Dave. He knew too.
She own you, Jimmy?
You'd do anything for me?
You promise?
So it's true, then?
Why?
So tell me.
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
You heard what I said, Dil?
Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.
You killed my Jody?
You killed my Jody
Love me.
You do?
She was --
Meet Col --
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
So what do you need, Fergus?
See does he want some.
Tough work, that.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
Of course. I forgot.
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
Back in a minute, Jody
What?
And who is she?
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
What do you mean you can't?
I seen your fucking face.
What's that?
What makes you think that?
They won't let him die.
Why can't we?
Shut the fuck up, would you?
Why not?
I got sent.
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.
Can't.
Why?
See? I was right about you.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Having two pints in the Rock.
The best.
We don't look on it like that.
You liked her?
Don't think that way.
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
You stupid bastard --
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
What's the matter?
What is it?
Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
Yes, you told me.
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
Of course there is!
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- Élysées! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Only we call them agents.
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
Oh.
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
No.
Bartholomew?
What's your first name today?
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
Keep going.
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?
It's the only name I've got. How about you?
Why you lied to me.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Who told you to do that?
The phone's ringing --
What day is it?
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
Or Tex?
What's so illogical about that?
I'd love some, thanks.
No sense messing up the streets.
Got you.
No -- not yet.
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move.
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
About how wealthy would you say?
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
Of course it is.
Oh, la.
Up there! It is up there!
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Please, not on my account.
Is your husband with you?
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
How did you find out?
Instant divorce you mean?
Of course? I thought he was dead.
I don't think I follow you.
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
On the street where you live.
Do you know what's wrong with you?
There was no trace of him. All right, Reggie -- suppose you tell me what this is all about.
What?
Go on.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
You know what I want, Miz Lampert...
It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?
Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
Have you no idea who could have done it?
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
I don't see him.
Why?
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
Good.
It's almost ten o'clock.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
A little.
No honey.
It was a she.
What did you hear?
St. Michael's.
She was murdered?
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
We just found another body.
You fucked me up!
We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born.
Go sit next to him.
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
I promised I'd go right home after school.
Someone tried to kill me.
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
This place is empty.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
Are you coming to the party?
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
Jody. Wait.
Lisa Sherman?
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
You're so beautiful.
You can't bring it.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
I said no.
At least somebody likes this shit.
Damn.
Shit!
...yeah.  Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
Great. 
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
Since today.  New policy.
Sorry, man.  He's dead.
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
You want cash?
I got, uh....
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
Come on, get in the truck.

No cell.
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
Yeah, borrowed!

Shut up.

I was thankin' you, asshole!
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
...up!
Fuck! 


Come on, old Pete.
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
Come on...
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
Ho, ho...

...you're dealin' with!
...here!
I don't want you to come anyway. 


Uh-oh.
Robert Del Rio?
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...
Yeah.
...deal with this asshole.
 

Listen, Arlo.
Arlo, shut up.
Hey, hey, hey.
Arlo!  Arlo.


 All right.  Okay.
Arlo!

Come here.
...to him. 
Whoo!
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
All right 

 Well.
Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.
Stop limpin' around like that.
You did help a little.
 Yeah.
...-tiatin'.
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
I was undercover as a tennis player.
 you see, that was a-that was my mission.
What'd he say?
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?

...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
All right, gentlemen. We're about done here.  Fine job.
Exactly.
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
...-bility.
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.
No!

No, go--
...that.
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
"Went away."  I like that.
I can't say it's a surprise.
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
 There's nothing in here, sir.  They got away with it.

Dennis, radio the bikes.  I wanna know if so much as a squirrel...
Well.  It appears someone's been lying to us.
You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?
Hit him.
It's clean.
Sir, all potential customers have been informed of the delay.  Fur-...
Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
Shit.
What about these two?
...-mand out of Fort Bragg.
Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at...
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
We gotta get help.  Aw, fuck!  Damn.
....-lene.
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
Doc...

...the river.
...-tainer!

...and unharmed, de-...



Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?
...it.
...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
Uh, we both like to fish.
Ah.

Video lock.
No sign of 'em...

Thanks. 
A man named Tim Ma-...
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...
The compound has to be kept cold...
And what if it does?
Yeah, I just....
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
...you answer mine.
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
...stole a truck under arrest.
 
Yeah, I'm sure.
Uh, so head for the other end of the tunnel.
I'll stay here and secure this position.
Negative.  Negative.
 There's ammo fire from Brynner's vehicle.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
How did she get that idea?
They're calling it an accident.
Lou Escobar – he's a Lieutenant.
Oh yes.
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
Yes, his girlfriend.
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
What about her?
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Is she all right?
Where is she?
...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
Haven't the faintest idea.
What's that, Curly?
...No...
What kind of guy do you think I am?
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.
There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.
Why?
Where did you get this material?
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
I don't want it anymore.
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
I want the rest of the pictures.
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
What are you talking about?
I know what he says.
Where?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
No.
A complete surprise?
Not that Mulwray?
Iced tea.
My husband's at the office.
That's not his apartment.
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
You left your keys in the ignition.
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
Mr. Gittes.
Is there anything else you want to know?
Yes... why?
Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
It was in Chinatown.
Working for the District Attorney.
What's wrong?
What about it?
Where?
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
I'll take care of it.
Walsh here?
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
Who?
Oh my goodness.
I'm sorry. We don't.
Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
I said, the northwest valley.
Mr. Gittes?
Yeah.
It's bone dry, Morty.
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
Yeah?... I do?
Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Mr. Mulwray, please.
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
He did or he didn't?
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
Apple core?
So he says you sent them?
Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
What are you doing here?
'I choose my friends for their looks, and my enemies for their brains...'  You're too smart to be my friend. Besides, as I always tell my kids, be careful to pick the right friends!
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
You understand which side the gelatin's on?
How's school?
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
Now what can you see?
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
I don't care. I'll wait.
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A new broom sweeps clean.
Let's hope they like it there.
Go in and ask him to hurry.
I might make him nervous.
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that.  He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie -
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!
I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
But, Mr. Kane -
I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend -  - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this -  I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.
And the notice?
Yes, Mr. Kane.
We haven't heard from him.
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane.
Let him finish, Charles.
Almost two to one -
Emily!
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
Oh!!
Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -
Toothache.
What's funny now?
Oh!
Hey, you should be more careful. That's my ma and pa.
Oh!
A chicken?
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you.  They just 0
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane.  If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.  Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson. 
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
Impossible!  Impossible!
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.
Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
I mean I've got a job for you.
Why not?
What do you mean by that?
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
All right.
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
I'll sign those papers -
Mr. Leland, you were -
What's this?
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
I know, but -
Thompson!
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
Are you sure?
What's this?
Jesus!
Beats me.
I think you'd better leave now.
That's it, everybody out.
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
She said not to come home until graduation.
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
Can I use the bathroom?
Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
Train. It took eight hours.
You saw it?
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
Was I right?
You don't have anything to do with it.
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
You're serious. You want to date again.
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  God! That was so great!
There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
Are you open?
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
Pack of cigarettes.  Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper.  She's marrying an Asian design major.
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
Cute cat. What's his name.
You open?
What am I worried about?  He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests.  I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor.
So?
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
Great story, isn't it?
Allan Harris.
Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!
Empire.
You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
What's he looking for?
The quest isn't going well?
The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
Vermont?
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
Don't yell at me, pal.
He's blunt, but he's got a point.
Design major.
Helluva game!
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Julie Dwyer died.
Why not?
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
Shut the hell up.
Stop it.
Oh, my god.
He made it, hunhh?
I could never reach.
I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
Her fucking body fell out!
Let me borrow your car.
What's that for?
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
Holy shit. That girl?
You're lying.
Now I know you're lying.
You're kidding.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
There's no lights back there.
She said she did all the work.
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
I thought I was doing you a favor.
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
Why do you say that?
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
How do you figure?
Do you work tomorrow?
Get the fuck outta here already.
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
You know him?
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
Oh for God's sake!
Go open the video store.
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
You used to go out with her?
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
Be careful.
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
The white kind.
Actually, it is kind of rough.
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
The porno mags?
Here. Now leave me alone.
All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
At least they weren't lit.
You're kidding.
I was kidding.
Oh, you think so?
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
What the hell was that for?
Three?
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Yeah, right.
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
Hey! Where are you going?!
Really?  You're the best.
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
You couldn't get these shutters open?
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
A couple...?
Would you let me explain...
It stings a little.
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
I'm not out of shape!
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
I think the lady called it.
I do about three-fifty, four.
You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
Sure. How about the beach?
I beg your pardon!
I'm not sad.
The guy ain't here yet.
Dental School.
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
Work!  Don't say that word, man.
C-4?
Ready to die quiet-like, asshole.
Hal's signalling he's OK.
Go on, fetch.
Jessie!  Are you alright?
Where are you, Walker?
The money!
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
I love you, too.
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
She's tough.
Please -- oh, no -- please!
He knows it well.
The winds are picking up.
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
Excuse me?
Did I miss something?
Resuscitation?
Where?
Thank God you didn't leave.  We just got a Mayday.  Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
What if he can't?
I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
A simple yes or no would have done.
What was God thinking when he built this place?
Can you see light?
We might be able to go that way.
My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
What do you think?  Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it.
What's he doing?
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
You said there was a way across.
What's your names?
Right.
Travers!  Hurry it up.
Why didn't you send the money over?
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
Where's the third one, Travers?
What did you do that for?
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
Come on, Alex. Come for walkies. Hahahahaha.
Dear, dear, dear. Whatever happened to you, my boy? Mr. Alexander, now confined to a wheelchair, pushes himself away from his desk, and rolls up to Julian. The water drips off Alex's clothes. They look at each other.
No, my health doesn't allow it.
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
Help you.
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Fine, sir, fine.
Thank you very much, sir.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
Why didn't you let us know what was happening, son?
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair.
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
Do you feel that way now?
All right, no more picking on Dim, brother. That's part of the new way.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
Not tonight - not this nochy.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when I wake up in the middle of the night with my pain.
Thank you, sir.
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
Hey, Dad, there's a strange fella sitting on the sofa there munchy- wunching lomticks of toast.
What do I want?
Let me get up.
... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
Crime?
Yes sir.
Religion?
Blue eyes?
Have you ever had any mental illness?
Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
Fucking hell...
And when do I get out of here then?
You needn't take it any further, sir. You've proved to me that all this ultra-violence and killing is wrong and terribly wrong. I've learned my lesson, sir. I see now what I've never seen before I'm cured, praise Bog!
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
How many to a cell?
But Bowery's fine, if that's what you want.
The ride is free.
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
Like what?
You like being a lawyer?
Annie...it's Max.
Where are you, what floor?
This your current address?
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.
Remember what you played?
I see.  That was an important list, wouldn't you say?  The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge.  And you "lost" it?
Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent.
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
Something going on?
...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?
Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke.
It's nothing.
I'm sure you're very proud of Max.
You're gonna cheer up.
I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!
He's not paying you one cent!
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
He'll keep calling.
Yeah?  So?
Hello?
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
You prefer nights?
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
Regulations?  These guys don't even give you sick leave.  How much you pull down on a good night?
You - you killed him?
I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs...
Uh, look...why don't you just take the car...
You listening to me?
58th and Central.  You know it?
You said you were visiting friends!
Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
Are you breathing?
Music.
Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
Get rid of 'em.
Who's that?
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
So what?
Collateral damage.
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
You take one more step, I'll kill her.
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
Vincent.  Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed.
Would you have called her?
Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite?
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
And you believe me...?
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
Slow the hell down!
Max?
What happened?
That's love.
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
I was only going one way.
What're you thinking, Jerry?
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
I don't see the connection.
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
What was your horse's name?
I bit the bastard's nose off.
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.
What's the charge?
He says a dog bit his nose.
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
See?  Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
So why are they after you?
You okay?
If my universe had a hub...
Here it is.  <u>Conspiracy Theory</u>  It just went out Tuesday.  Third issue this year.  I bet I struck a nerve.  Pissed someone off.
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
Has this happened to you before?
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.
Please put it down.
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
Murdered?
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
You will?
I don't know what to say.  I love you.
Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
What is it?
We're going to Queens?
Now what?
After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
Connecticut.
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
My father's house.
Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
Blue moon...
Geronimo is down.
Do I know you?
What's that?
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
Excuse me?
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
What I'm about to tell you is partially documented.  The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't.  For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
I'm still listening.
Where'd you get it?
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
We're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up.  This guy Fletcher's something else.
Which way did he go?
That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.
What gave me away?
He's why I watch Jerry.  Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
He died...  ... in 1972.
Hope there's a cartoon.
What in the hell...?
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
David --
What?
You...
Right.  Well.
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
What's the status of the decryption effort?
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
How's the spying tonight, guys?
Here, right around Centaurus A.
Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin.
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
So.  What happens now?
Some kind of circuitry...?
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
I thought you were here because you want to go.
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
We could be together again --
But what about your research -- ?
But the work --
I'm serious about this, Peter --
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go.
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one.  How did you do it?  How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
Buck is a deal.
How'd you find me?
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
Lookit her bounce.
What's all this dirt in the yard?
You got your mind right, Luke?
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
You can't do that!
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
But there's still daylight left.
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
Lemme see it!
Oh lookit that brunette.
Somebody say somethin'?
Whatta you so happy about?
Man, this here Newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself Luke don't know nuthin' 'bout nuthin'.
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
Man, it's so hot.
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
Kick a buck.
But -- but --
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
The moon is up, my night to howl. Will you be okay?
It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
We'll get the paramedics...
Tell her we're sorry we bothered her.
Hello, Daryll Lee.
What book?
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor impulse control.
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
Is it an ongoing case?
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
Ruben.
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
Is that it?
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
I just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  Of you both!
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
Who's the married man?
Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...
Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
I don't want this.  What are they?
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
Tell me what to do!
You know how to use this?
Okay.
Who came in after you?
It's none of my business anymore...
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
Snotty neurotic bitch...
You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
She's blue as hell.  No marks on her neck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same -- no ligature marks.  Outdoors...
Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.
She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
There was no sperm.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
I'm <U>telling</u> you.  Don't you <u>ever</u> address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and <u>who</u> I tell you to work.
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?
Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler?  This is the fourth, is that correct?
We were together six years, sir!
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
Is that a gift from Wendel? It has an aeronautical feel to it.
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
Do you find him attractive?
Have you seen his penis?
You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
Isn't that rather too close...?
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
Can you drive?
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.
You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?
Yeah, everything's under control.
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
What's all the dreck?
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
Will you get time off to do that?
Tell us every detail.
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
Oh no.
Mom, please.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
Ruth's already taken him home.
Honestly, Letty.
I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.
I'm really not that hungry.
It had this red spot on its back.
I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
Don't take it personally.
Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
But you're checking it out.
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
Guess which hand.
Guess.
Really, this isn't funny.
No.
I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
Shocking, huh?
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
Well?
So there were no problems?
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?
You've got to see the kitchen first.
I love your apartment.
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
Not yet.
Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.
This must be Beast.
Who ever said sanity was fun?
I think I should go home.
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
Silly?   Silly am I?
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
Are you all right?
Yes, I suppose so.
Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
No, you've done a perfect job.
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
How's it look?
Agent Hadley.
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
Okay.   How much?
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
Someone else coming?
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
I don't know.
For what?
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
Bring me the scissors.
Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
We still have to get out of here.
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
All right, knock it off.
Hadley --
I'm from Belgium.
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
Maybe you should call the police.
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
Just find them!
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
What hotel?
The map said to go left.
They don't have a wine list.
Yes.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
It's good.
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
Anybody know about that car outside?
No.   It's mine.
Yeah.
I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
Algeria.
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
Did she break your heart?
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
What are you doing?
Sounds boring.
Who are you waiting for?
She seems pleasant enough.
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
Okay.    Okay.
You're back!
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
Go ahead.
And if I use them to kill you?
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
You write gracefully.  Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
You say she killed a policeman?
Here you must be in proper attire.
They forced me to marry!
Where is he now?
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Let's end this here.
Your father's men are still looking for you.  They're still out there, circling closer.
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
She needs direction... and training.
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope...
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate.
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
But the sword could be in his compound.
We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble.
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
My name.
Thank you.  For giving a damn.
It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy.
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
Don't interfere.
Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
You gotta go now, I bet.
You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
Do you know what you destroyed?
A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
I wish to possess what you have now.
How the hell did you do that?
No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
What the hell are you?
Glad to see you're finally with the program.
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
We've got company.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
I'm Kathryn.
Thank you.
I have his journal.
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
You promise not to say anything?
How do you know I've been with several women?
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
Romantic? He rapes her.
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
How's the water?
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
It was fine.
And that's a bad thing?
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
Somerset Maugham.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
Because I'm in love with you.
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
You really want to know?
Good for you.
Hi.
I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house.  Was it --
Would you like a tour?
Why aren't you understanding?
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
Are you shitting me?
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
I'm in the bath, mom.
What are you scared of?
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
Does your mother know?
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
If that's what you call it.
I look terrible.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
No. This is going to be our last session.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit.
Greg, is that you under the covers?
Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes!
She bought it.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
Why not?
I'll think about it...
You can put it anywhere.
No.
Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
That her?
Shut up.
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
You didn't?
Oh come on. For her first time?
No, tell me.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
Why so nervous?
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
You're too kind.
What about her?
Ronald? That's crazy.
I can't thank you enough.
Hi. Is Annette at home?
Well please leave a message that I called.
What do you want?
I'll do that.
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
Where the hell do you come off hitting women?
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were.  I hope you'll come to see us.
Oliver's pet,  I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
What are saying, darling?
The Farren house
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
She was very pretty.
Irena.
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.
Where is everybody?
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
Something's haywire,
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
What's funny?
Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
These are all from me.
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
Will you be friend for always?
Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead.  You be the friend who comes to see me.  I'll show you my children.
All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
I shall wear it in my hair!
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
Because it can't. It's dead.
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
The Headless Horseman --
I hate the storm. I hate it!
I thought we were going to save those leaves you were burning for the compost bin.
I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
Waiter! She needs more water.
No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.
A dog at Victoria's Secret?
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
My shrink says he's not so bad.
He hasn't said one word to me.
I think she broke the skin.
So did you do it?
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
What the hell is the tampon test?
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
I've been here. What day is it?
What happened to his tooth?
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
Why the fuck would you do that?
What the fuck are we going to do?
Fall in love.
About Benito.
I know.
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
Mark.
The Nielson's?
Coffee and...
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
You busted me.
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
Oh, it's nothing.
Like what?
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
What's with the squirt guns?
If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
You can't believe this bullshit.
How the hell is that your business?
You want her sheets?
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
He means the last that we know of.
Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
What are you talking about?
So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
I need something to keep me awake.
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
Mnunn.  Cold lately.  That night, couple weeks ago.  That was <u>real</u> cold.  Remember that?
What's he doing here?
Police.  Nobody move.
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnít this his case?
Why do you want to speak to him?
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
Where are we going?
I don't know who they are.
Where do you think this goes?
They've taken my mind, my memories...
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
A fanciful idea, Mister White.
I see.  Then who is after you?  What sins have you committed?
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
What does she say?  The woman.
If you like.
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
How do you know I'm innocent?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
What's with her?
Mr. President...
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
Choices???
What do you think you're doing?!
You're nothing.  Do you understand me! You're NOBODY...
... what?
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
Clean.
Check his kids.
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.
I'll lock him away for good.
Uh-oh...
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
They could put you in jail.
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
No.
In the car.
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
Fine.
We've got to fix this.
Yes, Mr. President?
This is from the people of Burundi...
They re not my attack dogs.
Yeah.
How'd you get started?
So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job?
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
Who?
Well...
Don't you have anything to say to me?
Look.  If there was some mistake...
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now?   After the election...  What's going on here? Dave hesitates.
Where's home?
You know, secretaries and stiff.
What's wrong?
Yeah.   He's a good man.
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
It could be fun.
I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet.  We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
What is it?
Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about.
The great state of Florida. People came here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here...died...went to hell...and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
What?
This stuff really works? No shit?
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours.
NOOOOOOOOO!
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
Tricks...Jesus...
No relation.  Never heard of him. Sorry.
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
The millions are awake enough for Physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life.  To be awake is to be alive.
Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!
How'd it go?  Did you read it to her?
All right.  I'll try anything once.
I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation.  In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
That's right, it's Nuwanda.
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
Hey, he's your roommate.
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying
Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?
You what?!  How did you do that?
You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie.  You don't speak for the club.
What happened? Were you kicked out?
Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it?
Hello?
If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
God, if Chet found out he'd...
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
I have to go home. Chet might call.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Too bad.
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
You really think I should forget her?
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.
But if he said no before then...
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
You the Captain?
Who are you?
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent.
Hanover, listen...
Who gives a shit about aft?
What other bunch?
I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
Noooo!
You don't have to be so touchy.
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
Where's you friend?
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit sqaud.
You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
Joey... Which way's aft?
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.
What was that?
Who's full of shit?
They did too!
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious!
Fucking A.
Nick! Nick, you'll kill him!... Easy. Nick, easy! Hey, hey. Vince goes back a long way.
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
See, I'm going home.
No. None of that.
'Course how could you miss, right? Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean, if I'd'a been where you guys were --
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because...
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
How are you?
Frost.
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
Nick?
What are you doing?
You're going hunting?
You seem... disturbed.
Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?
Playing?
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
What are you, hoping?
How many bullets?
Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you?
Bullshit! That's bullshit!
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
No.
You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle. You know that? You're one fucking bastard!
See you Monday.
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
What's that noise?
Did you get one?
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
What the hell was that!  What did you think? Did you think it was loaded!
Up I would say... What would you say?
Down I would say... What would you say?
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
My man Dubbs.
Funny guy.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
Speak up.
I want to see my wife and kid.
Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
What is it?  I'm about to go on.
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
Kill him... kill him.
You two fucks listen up.  Doucet's killing people and you're wasting valuable time busting two-bit Technothugs.
You okay?
Sir---
You sure?  I can help you.
Does it drive itself, too?
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
Can I ask you something?
Hey, buddy...
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
Maybe I should turn myself in.
Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
You should be in hospital.
Demolition Man.
You never want to find out.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
The people, Jabez -- the people.
Jabez -- ?
You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?
You know that you're in my house.
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
Gee -- that Fair --
Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!
Howdy, Jabez.
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Loan shark -- hey?
What do you want?
Good evening -- I'm sorry, Jabez -- I'm a little late.
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
You know darn well it is.
Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Coming along, Jabez?
Why -- good morning, Squire.
Dan'l Webster?
Yes.
Down, Shep! Down!
I think his leg is broken.
I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.
" ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?
Remember, Mary, how he said it: "Couldn't have done better myself, Jabez Stone," and it was my first speech. I don't know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth.
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
Why don't they come --
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper.
What's ailing that dog?
Do you really think that?
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!
Mr. Webster, I presume?
Why, certainly -- but be careful, Mr. Scratch -- Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself. 
Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.
What are you going to do?
John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works.
No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan.
Bad for your health anyway.
You...you're an American?
Yo!
You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.
Hey, I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there.
Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do they put in these things?
Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.
Al?  Al, you there?
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
They way you drive, I can see why.
Powell?  What's going on?
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
These seats come out?
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
Yeah.  A lot of guns.
No.  Look, we're kind of....
How are you doing?
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
What are you talking about?
Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
That's it.
These guys that got me down here, you know, huh... they think that I'm part of this whole thing.  They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank!
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
You try calling the police?
Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?
You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close.
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
Sonny, be reasonable!
The girl hostages.
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
I want to talk to him.
We're all set at Kennedy.
Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?
What if I take you with me?
You tell me.  Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out.
I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.
You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
What is it, Sam?
When was the last time you saw Sal?
Did you know he was a homosexual?
Because I don't want cancer.
No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you understand?  You're pure!
You shouldn't start now.
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
Ah, Jesus...
... The bodies out the door.
I want him to think that.
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
Bullshit!
What's wrong?
Sonny!  Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please?
I ain't eaten all day.  I just realized it.
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.
Oh - Maria!
What are you trying to pull?
Here's your document, Sonny.
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...
I can't, Mom.  If I come out Sal will kill them.
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...
Newsman, not ...
You could give up.
What happened to my money, Mr. Williams? <b> INT. CLAREMONT WILLIAMS III BOND AGENCY -- NEXT </b> Claremont sits behind his desk with his phone to his ear.
Morning.
Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
I'm so sorry to be bothering you in the middle of the night like this... but it's a bit of an emergency.
You're breaking up... I can't hear you.
Okay.
She's right... you lost your temper... and you started cursing like some ghetto skank. You lost all credibility right there!
I've already formulated a plan.
You motherfuckin' Tino. You fucked us so bad.
Is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to Drake Bishop... owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?
Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?
LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!
<i>Either this was some kind of set up... or the First Ladies got scared... decided to pull out and cut their losses.</i>
So who is this <i>Choko?</i> Is he your new boyfriend?
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
So Ed. What did you do before you became a bounty hunter?
How did you meet Choco?

Something is going down. Something bad.
They need to get the introduction on camera. Just play along, alright?
I don't like anything else.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Ya back is got.
What did he do this time?
Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
How much?
What can you say?
The evil eye doesn't work on me.
You're a drunk fool.
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
Where did you sleep?
I hope the block is still standing.
I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
Jade, I don't want you coming in here no mo'.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
Nice!
You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
...peanuts.
Jade, you're late.
This might take some time.
That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!
It's Miller time.  Let me go give these Koreans s'more business.
I didn't say nobody, I said you.
Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him alone.
Mookie, get offa da phone.
Yeah, do you know 'em?
Whatdafuck do you want?
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
And I really wanted some ice cream too.
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
Why you gotta curse?
Tina, you're sweating.
Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum--
Pino, no joke.  C'mon, answer.
I'll be back after I make this delivery.
Me and you are gonna have a talk.
Pino, get a broom and sweep out front.
Hey!  Watch it.
Pino, relax, will ya.
Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a place of business.
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.

I don't get it. Why'd you make him a pirate?
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
Hey guys.
Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
Wipe your feet. My parents are totally anal.
Would you like something to drink?
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure?
Wow just like Marco Polo.
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.
H A R R Y...
Maybe we should ask Jessica to join the class.
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
Where did you learn that word?
HARRY.
No.
What's with horse-boy, now he's a bright shiny sun?
A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
I don't know. Owwww.
LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
What?
Nope. I was right.
Hey, where did you come from?
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
LLOYD, what are you doing? That's JESSICA and... my mom.
You certainly did.
Hey, look. Ice cream.
That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
What?
She's one of a kind.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
So can I come along?
You had some questions.
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
What are you doing here?
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Do I know you?
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
You really are a pirate.
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.
Have you got what I want?
Senior year. My little boy. Who woulda thunk it?  You're a good kid, Lloyd. I don't say it enough, but I'm proud of you son.
LLOYD, may I see you a minute?
What are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed?
That's not bad. How about a float of George Washington crossing the Delaware?
Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!
That's great, now make a left, then straight!
Ha! Too big to make the turn!
I think you did it.
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
Oh, just like the President.
What papers?
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
I sold all the wind instruments.  Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?
This is horse?
My Lord!
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
What's that you're saying?
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
So, this is Leto the Just...
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
Man-carved steps.
Are you a Fremen?
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
We call that one Muad'dib.
My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
No.  I don't work here.
Why were you buying a coffin?
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
Are you sure this is okay?
Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
Should I call a doctor?
What's in the needle?
No Bela, that's "incorporates."  Look, just say "This casket has..."
Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.
You'll be sitting on the right.
Do you know I turned down "Frankenstein"?
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
Don't worry.
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
Last night was quite a romp.
Jesus!  Are you serious?
I've never seen anything like him!
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!
I don't understand.
Dolores, give me your shoes.
No!  A horror movie star!
No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.
Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
But there's plenty of other parts.
That's right...
That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
For this one, we need $60,000.
Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
And PERFECT.  CUT!
No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
Here's the scene.  Loretta, you're in a trance.  You glide in and get on the operating table.  Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down.  But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.
Tor, I should be getting home.
What is happening?
Excuse me, Sir...?
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
You look beat.
Did you find it boring?
Oh.  Okay.
Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat --
You're sure this is gonna work?
Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.
...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
No. The bathroom is off limits -and when I go to sleep they go to other programming. Unless I get up. Then they go back on the air. Unless I get up to go to the bathroom, I guess, then -
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
What do you love her or something?
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
Oh, Al ... This is just...
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
You think she really likes him?
Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?
Uh-huh?
Ed, do you want my advice?
Leave her be.
Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --
Ed --
I don't think so.
He's who we want to go with.
Mr. Pekurny.
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
I thought -- I thought he was dead.
What?
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
So he killed himself.
Are the TV people with you?
Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --
I can't believe you're taking his side.
Yes.
All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
I'm at the hospital.
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
Hi, Mom. 
She won't.
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
I batted!
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
Are you sure about this?
So?
Don't defend that horse's ass to me.
Ha!
I mean bad.
Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
Where?
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.
Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
What do you mean all of a sudden? You've been going with her six months.
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
I'm making a tape.
I got your message. Way to go!
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
Polish acrobat.
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
Marcia's living with a singer?
I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?
Good-bye, brother!
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
Ray, where do you keep the glasses?
Hi, Shari.
Who is it?
I was in jail.
No. Two times.
Hi.
Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah... those are funny...
Oh!!
Can I help with anything?
Ohhh...
Ohh... do you own a cat?
How?
You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
what?
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
Yeah. No. I mean, you know.
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!
Hello, Mr. M.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Handles pretty good, don't you think?
Plenty of pep, too.
I want you to do something for me.
I hope so
Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
Could you get this? I can't
More this way.
I can't afford this stuff right now.
Right now?
What do you want, Jim?
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
What...?
Who put you up to this?
Hell, good luck!
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
Can I get you a drink?
Tell me about Patchett.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
Do you enjoy it?
Lad, may I have a word with you?
Captain, what do you want?
He helped me out once.  That's all.
They're yours.  Take them.
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
Will you work for me?
You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp.
You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
What's through here?
Yeah, that's Stens.
Dudley.
What?
You expecting problems?
It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
No.
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
Should I?
How 'bout I give you your balls back?
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire.
Where are the police academy files?
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?
That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.
Dudley, we've been over this.
No.
No.
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
Why?
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
Something like that.
John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath.  Don't start now.
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
You're the key witness?
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
Damnit...
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
I get the idea.  You got a description?
It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.
Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
Where will you go?
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned.
It's Christmas morning in the City of Angels, and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous, hopheads prowl for marijuana, not knowing that a man is coming to stop them.  The free- wheeling, big-time Big V, celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes, the scourge of grasshoppers and junk fiends everywhere.  You like it, Jackie- Boy?
No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice.
You're back, boychick.
The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
Around.
Shut up!
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Pacific Coast Bell.
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
Have we met before?
Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back.
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
What happened?
DePinto's dead.
What'd he say to you?
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
Um...who's that?
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
No one. But I'm a little nervous.
I'll come straight there.
We've also been informed that the Grand Jury is going to call for an investigation into your affairs.
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
One of many people who would live a word with you.
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
Okay.
What <u>is</u> that?
I don't know what that--
How many years have <u>you</u> been hiding from them? How many years have you been running?  What'd they do to you?
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?
I didn't use my name.
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
The NSA killed him.
Here?
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
We lost 'em.
Goddammit--
How?
Reynolds.
You wanna get caught spying on Albert?
Hi, Mr. Dean.
I know, but--
Because my life is being ruined.
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
Was he with anyone?
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, <u>way</u> outa line.  You understand?
Hey.
You should take this seriously.
What do you mean?
Sorry.
He's got his priorities?
I think you should leave now, Robert.
Stacy--
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
The lingerie.
Who?
Actually, that's not true.
I gotta go.
I know.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
Rachel--
This conversation's over.
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
He didn't.
Otherwise you may have to what?
Otherwise you may have to what?
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
They claim you helped create a shell company for Sam Vollotti in Zurich and that through your continuing relationship, the Gambino family's been able to exert influence and provide false witnesses to discredit our case.
Gentlemen--
Bobby--
I don't under--
Excuse me, have any of you seen an eight year old boy, good looking, about yea-big.
You're learning a cruel lesson.
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
No.
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
What?
Can I talk to you a second?
Ssh!
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
Yes.
They're framing me.
I don't know!
You gotta--
No, I--
Bobby? Piece of advice?
Yeah.
It means who's side are you on?
There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i> buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
Yes?
Yes?
How much did you pay?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
When were you most happy?
What do you hate most?
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
Dance with me.
Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
Don't leave me!
Shall we be all right?
Oh dear.
And a good read.  Don't waste it.
Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love.  Excessive love of one's wife.
Safe journey.
I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
Very well.
Have you seen Katharine?
Good morning!
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
Look, either shut up, or go home.
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
How are you?
No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there.
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
Supper. Hana calls after him.
What do you do?  What are you doing here?
Who are his ghosts?
What if I told you he did this to me?
I think that's called looting.
Thief, I think, is more accurate.
I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
Have a drink.
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
The team is in mourning, darling.
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England.
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
Could I have a cigarette?
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
He needn't disturb you.
Excuse me -
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
Arguing about books.
What do I do?
So I follow the wires?
What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever… you and Lieutenant Singh…
Whoa - give me a chance!
Your book.  Your Herodotus! Almásy looks uncomfortable.
Certainly not.
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.
Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.
You ordering chop suey again?
And the draft blew over the flowers.
You don't call, you don't write.
How close?
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
Why are we speaking Chinese?
I can't?
How about if I try humility.
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
Seems I am.
I've got something for you.
For God's sake.
Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
I know.
We going somewhere?
Very nice.
Fine. What do I do?
But--
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
Motorcycle.
That's entrapment.
I don't believe this.
Lose something?
Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?
Only a week?
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
So you're testing <u>me</u> now?
So how long to pop the floor?
I trust it's your size.
Aren't we early?
They moved it.
Be careful not to break the laser beams.
Careful...careful.
No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?
I'll need the Rembrandt now.
What about the rules?
The eight billion. From them to us.
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
The sign of our partnership.
Relax, don't jam it...
The door's the only way out!
He looks familiar.
In the van.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
The key to success is using the right tools.
We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.
I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
Oh, it is.
You look like George Washington.
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
You two make quite a couple.
She's calling the shots now.
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
You'll just have to have faith.
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?
Hi.  Donna Irving?
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
I know.  They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease.  That's a kind of cancer --
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
I don't even know how much money that is.
I can put them in a good school.
What are you doing here?
So what made you think it was?
Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.
Then I don't get anything either.
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
What now?
You wanna talk about --
Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
Is that what you want?
I'll see what I can do.
What's a demur?
Counts?
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
When?  Where?
Why not?
I don't know what to say.
I was wrong.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.
Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee.
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
So that stuff -- it kills people.
Hunh-uh.  What's that?
County water board.  All righty, thanks.
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
Mommy, can I get a flower?
Hey, Ros, where are they?
Can I play roller hockey?
God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
Well, hello to you, darlin'.
Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different.  Let's start over.  My name's George.  What's yours?
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
What are you doing here?
It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
About this.
It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
They up?
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
I'm embarrassed.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but -- I'm just a little unclear on what those things are.  I thought maybe you'd know.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
Where's my paycheck?
It'll be fine, yeah.
What?
Wow, that's soon --
Dr. Paulsen?
Oh.  Oh.
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
... Luke, you must not go.
Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
Barks a blue streak.
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
Barks a doleful farewell.
Barks at his master.
We should have stayed and finished them off.
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
Barks his consternation.
Give me that!
... I told you, I'm not hungry.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
Because of my father, I guess.
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
Good, and Commander Skywalker?
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
That's right.
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.
I do not!
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.
Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
He found him in a junk pile ...
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
About what?
Are you kidding?
How's your mining operation going?
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.
Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
What?
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
Someone's falling.
The deflector shields are gone.
The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
Closer?!
The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.
Yes, My Lord.
We shall want a full autopsy ...
Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
Who's that?
Give it.
Oh Cuervo...
He's... near.
How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
Got a smoke?
I said pull over.
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
How do we get out of here?
Snake - what is it?
Well, I'll think it over.
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
All of us?
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir...
There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you.
But your life and lands are far from here.
My domain is here, inside this metal skin. And I would pledge to you all that I still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it.
Your deeds set an example for all other knights. For your gift, ask a gift of me.
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming...
Who is Merlin?
You saved me from the arrow...
I want to thank you.
Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--
A king must marry, after all.
Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.
Guenevere...
I should have left you to fend for yourself.
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...
What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
And you cannot love me...
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
There are things about love--
Why didn't he kill us?
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
It is.
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
They do.
Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
You provoke me, Merlin.
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
What honey?
No, he's working on another book.
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
It's-
I'm sorry.
Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
Good morning Madame.
Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
Chris MacNeil?
Did he tell you about my party?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
I didn't get you?
Oh yeah, since when?
Wanna drink.
Where's Regan's father?
Well, not while we're in Washington.
You really don't want me to play huh?
Captain who?
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
What are you doing here?
Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop! It's burning, it's burning please mother!
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you and eat. For this is my body." When the supper had ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise. Gave the cup to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you will drink from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith".
Do it again.
What's that?
I'm all right.
Is that too tight?
No.
We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He is a liar, the demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological , Damien. And powerful. So don't listen, remember that, do not listen.
And let my cry come unto thee.
And also with you.
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
...look down in pity...
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
Give me the keys.
Yeah, come on in.
What's this?
Twelve years.
Maybe next time.
Well, look at this.
What's our friend's problem?
What's wrong with them?
Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right before the accident.
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
Oh my God ...
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it been, Jack?
Don't make trouble, all right?
You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
You're their uncle.
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
Your older brother.
So what'd we get her?
I made her nervous.
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
That's what we agreed.
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
Jack.
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
What's the matter?
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.
Oh, brother.
Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'
Hey, Frank.
Just a lucky guess.
You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
I thought we all had separate rooms.
He's drunk.
Have some more wine, Frank.
I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?
We might as well do the towels the same way.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
You leaving that on?
All night?
Why would I mind?
What?
Really.
You saw wrong.
Expensive hangover.
Couple years.
April.
A useless talent.
I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
What're you doing?
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
What?
What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
You weren't there.
Jack!
Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there. If you want to get started.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you.
A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.
You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
Uh... he knows it.
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
This is show business?
I sing now?
When?
Ready?
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
Come on.
What do you think?
Shoes?
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
Oh, thanks.
The switch.  Hit the switch.
Fucking.
I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.
Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.
Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.
Whatcha doin' over there?
Right.  Bring him back.
Save it.  What's he look like?
Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
So why's he do it?
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
What's the matter?
All I said was you were good.
You were good.
Nina?
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
History.
Oh. So what's it doing here?
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
He had a mind that escalated things.
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
What kind?
Jack.
Let me get the light.
Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
Yeah.
Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
Older than me.
Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?
Merry Christmas, Jack.
There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
Do I look wasted -- asshole?
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
Jesus Christ, Castor.
Why would he need more?
Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
That's not the worst part.
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
... I was dreaming ...
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
No.
Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
Who is this?
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
Which ear was it?
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
You killed them?
You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
When did you start smoking?
Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie.  And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
Kim?
You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
-- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me.  The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero!  I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.
You'd have to start immediately.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
-- what?
Where's Jamie?
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
Hello?
That’s right. And auto supply...
Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
We’re almost done here...
I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
Try not to be late because kids don’t like to be the last one picked up.
Very nice. What is it?
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  It’s throwin’ everybody off.  What do you think?
What am I saying?  You don’t need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, that’s all.  Is that you?
She is relentless.
How’d you know my name?
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  You’re doing well...
Where’s my car?!  Where’s my Ferrari!?
Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
You just said everyone needs something.
No?  C’mon, Jack...I’ve got everything I need, I don’t have regrets, that’s just not for me... sound familiar?
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of ‘em take a couple seconds...  ...some of ‘em take a lot longer...
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
But what do I do?
Are we finally being honest?
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
Are you okay?
Where were you?
Jack...don’t even start...
Look, we don’t have time for this right now, we’ll talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  You’re not wearing that to the Thompsons’ party. I don’t care how hilarious you think it is...
Yes, I’m fine.  It’s just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!
Uh...that baby’s crying...
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
Wait a second.  You want me, don’t you?
How can you do that?
I think it worked out okay, don’t you?
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what would’ve happened if you hadn’t stepped in at the store.
You mean this chocolate cake?
C’mon, you know what I like to hear...
Not it...?
Maybe I should wait...
Now I’m worried...just say it.  Whatever it is we’ll deal with it.
I think it’s good to be a little unsure about who you are.  It’s very human.
C’mon, Jack, you think there aren’t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I’m doing in New Jersey...
Good things...
So what’s the big surprise? You didn’t rent this place for the weekend, did you?
I can’t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didn’t want to raise the kids here?
I can do that.  I want to do that.  For all of us. I need to do that as a man...  Think about it.  No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
Don’t do that...
I promise, Jack...
Kate...
I'm sorry...
You’re moving...
Don’t do this, Jack... But he continues...
Mrs. Peterson.
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
Those yours too?
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
What about his first born?
Can't do it.  I cannot do it.
I had it at four.
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Where...where am I?
You look like an eighties rock band.
<u>Where is Reed</u>?
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
He's not responsive --
Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
This is wrong in so many ways.
Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller.
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber.  It's muscle, tendon.  I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.
Me like-y.
I though we went over this.
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Come on, Ben, come on...
Which was?
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
There were a lot of variables to consider --
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
But <u>we're</u> the focus, right Reed? <u>Reed</u>...?
I can...make it work.
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
What are you doing?
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
'Scuse me.
I told you to cut down on the sugar.
-- and why we need you.
I assume Benes knows how to control it.
Just one, General...
I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.
Listen...the Heart.
But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
That's beside the point now.  I don't see the sense of going on.
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
Then how come it worked loose?
I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it.
You must carry spare parts --
No need to get up --
We can't take a second more.
It's against my better Judgment...
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't get enough to fill a microscopic tank.
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
How does it look, Doctor?
There it is!
All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
What'd you do that for?
Atomic fuel?
If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
What happened?
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
What's wrong, Skipper?
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
Or your fucking wife, you know.
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
Huh?
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
...You-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks?  - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any -
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.
...Who's Jean?
...Blood has been shed.
Look. I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry. The price is now the whole amount. We want the entire eighty thousand.
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
They can really take over, that's for sure.
I thought you'd never ask. The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan.
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
Oh, don't be silly.
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Just a general way.
The numbers y'asked for, calls made from the lobby pay phone at the Blue Ox. Two to Minneapolis that night.
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
Where you girls from?
Yah.
Uh-huh.
They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
I'm talkin' about your potential.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
Good to see ya again, Jerry. If these numbers are right, this looks pretty sweet.
The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
Yah.
...Yah, okay...
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
Hon? Got the growshries.
Yah, real good.
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Well... yah.
Yah.
Yah.
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
...Dad?
Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata?
Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money -
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
No kiddin'?
Stan and I're okay.
You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
Dammit! I wanna be a part a this thing!
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
Ya see something down there, Chief?
There's two of 'em, Lou!
Yah.
You look in his citation book?
How we doin' on that vehicle?
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.
Yah, that's me.
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
...This is a nice place.
Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you, Mike? Are you married - you have kids?
Better times.
...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...
Yah?
...Well, yah. Who's this?
Oh. Oh, my.
Copy.
Hon?
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
Was it reasonable?
Your mallard?
Yah.
I love you, Margie.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
I'm tellin' ya.
I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
Better than I've ever been in my life.
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down.  You can deal with anything.
I must've left the original in the copy machine.
This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.  We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.
I... I don't know.  I guess... when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead...
You're kidding.
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.
That's your favorite, too?  Tried to slip it by me, eh?
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
What is this?  Who did this?
Is this a trick?
You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to see you again!
Tyler...
What happened... ?
My God, you're shot...
Tyler?
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
Throwers don't worry about ticking. Modern bombs don't tick.
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
Well, I have to file a claim...
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
Yeah.
Thank you.
What?
They're called "cigarette burns."
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
A nice, big cock.
I don't know about this.
Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.
How do you feel?
What are you reading?
Hey... don't knock librarians.
Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand.
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
I asked you what you studied.
I feel sick.
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
What the hell ... ?!
This conversation...
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
Why did you do that?
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
What about Marla?
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
You want out?
Defuse the bomb?
What?
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
What are you doing?
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
His name is Robert Paulson!
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
I... I don't know...
That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
I didn't beat it; I hid from it. If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it.  Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others.  That's the worst killer of them all.
You have to tell us now.
What did you see?
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
What?
May we come in?
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
What's going on here?
Do you remember what triggered it all?
I tried calling last night but your father --
Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!
Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
It throws the entire Death list out of whack.  And a new list has to be rewritten from scratch.  We all start over with a clean slate.
Are you okay?  You just face planted!
I'm not sure... I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile- up.
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside.
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
That's why I was there last night.
That... him?
No.
Remember the departure time?
4:25.
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
Stop the car!
I'll remove him.
Fag.
Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
Cuticle lacerations.
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
I'm sorry we broke in.
I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?
This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.
You okay?
What do you call that?
I've seen worse places.
This place is a trip.
What's she saying?
That guy's not going to make it.
Can you handle the door gun?
You're gonna love it.
You really got a Masters Degree?
How did you get started working for the spooks?
Why'd they want us?
Look, Co...
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."
Where?
He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
Um... actually, no.  It looks like he shot down one of their gunships...
You think they'll find any?
What's up?
I know...
But you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
This your stuff?
Congressional Medal of Honor.
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
What?
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
Most men are.
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
<u>What</u>!
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
Hello....congratulations.
You're kidding!  What did he say?
What?
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't...
No.
Well!  What do you want me to do - applaud?
Yeah, I know the place.  It's one of those chic <u>yuppie</u> gathering holes.
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?
Come on now...You can't sit here.
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
A list.
Well there....  What's the difference?
Now what?
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
Where -- ?
The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it...
Parry.
...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?
SAW WHO!!?
Parry...
It's such a great song.
Happily married, probably.
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
I advise you to let us go.
Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!
Tell me more. I want to know everything.
Well, it's enough for me.
I don't drink coffee...
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
Give 'em the horn, Bob.
If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.
You're not going to play it again.
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.
That was damn good, wad'n it? I finally did it...
You like it?
Okay, Ray...
Come on.
How far are you going to?
Well...
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?
Oh.
Maybe you better stay, then.
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
You were going without saying goodbye?
Bye, now.
Yes, intentionally.
Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
Serious, that's what's important to you?
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
No, I can't...
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
I'm not aware of it. Like what?
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
No, you're not. Go ahead and take your time.
I don't think that's true.
You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you...
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
Don't call me "mack," honey.
Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
Fine.
I wanna go out with you, I want to be part of your life. I want you to treat me the way a girlfriend should be treated.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
Do you have a name?
Wussup?
Eddie from Compost?
What are you going that way for?
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
I'm gonna punch you. What you want with her anyway? You in love with her?
No.
You wanna do somethin' with me?
Hey!
Where you know Amanda from?
God I admire you.
Would you like me to change anything?
Maybe tonight?
Hey, what are you doing?
Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Right.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
No idea at all?
Like when?
For sure?
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
You find the source?
Can I get you something?
Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something.
I guess not.
You should have proved that in a court of law.
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attaché cases.
Then he has.
Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A... four years April.
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
John Ultramalensky, right?
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
Yo!
'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
Thanks.
Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did ---
Did you say cops?
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
His bride. Cute as a button.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
John who?
What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
I bet you do.
What's he doing in Utah?
Who is it?
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
You ordered it here?
I really should change.
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Good point.
A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
They just left, sir.
I would, actually.
You want I set up?
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
Where is she?
So you're saying she moved out.
Tell the cops.
I never read the paper.
What's the spread on the game tonight?
Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.
So let's go! We run the pictures.
Who?
Gummy and two cops...
More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
I have some ideas.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
Did she tell you anything?
What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
That was close...
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
I do it for love.
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them.  Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  Now's the fun part...
Hey, they blew me.
Let's get serious...
Because I know rock-n-roll.
This is boring, guys.
I'm afraid so, you want her?
Pretty smooth, huh?
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
Gut feeling.
Ouch.
I'm sorry...
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
So, did you find my dad?
Like me.
Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
Kill them.  Not quickly.
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
Shit.
And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
I'm still the king!
How nice.
What's my name?
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
What about you?  Can you stand a toss?
Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
What's your name, asshole?
I don't...
What?
Man, I'm clean.
It has to be by the end of this week.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Comment va-t-elle?
Are you sure it is dead?
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.
We must follow it.
All right, get up on that bar and dance.
Des Moines.
Where's he from?
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
No, you?
Monica?  Who's Monica?
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
Toy wit' this will ya.
I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
Why not?
The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute.
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
Timezit?
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
Why haven't they killed the juice?
Hey, bud.
How about a little of the King?
What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
He did.
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
I'm scared.
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
Sorry 'bout that.
What'd you say your name was?
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
You just burned the desk.
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
No, not yet.
What's that?
No wait, don't go!
Why?
On the job?
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
Dad, you there?  You okay?
What?  What is it?
Whatta you mean she's not here?
Murdered?  Why?
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
Yeah, you betcha.
John, you still there?
This is wrong...it's like we cheated...
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
Please, Dad, just do it.
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
Another rough night, huh?  That it?
He ain't our guy, John.
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you...
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?
Nah, just working the job.
No kiddin'?
Going?  How do you mean?
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
Who brought up this bright idea?
... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
Breakfast?
What was that?
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
What're you doing?
How do we do it?
Think you can figure it out?
What're you doin'?
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
I'm a slow eater.
It's dark down there.
Which one is it?
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
Come on down!
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else.  The nights are always so peaceful and quiet.
What happened that night?
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
You know him?
What d'ya got in there?
Faster!  Eat faster!
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
Is... is everything all right?
Please... be cool.
Are they following us?
What're you doing?
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
Why do you do these stupid things?!
Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
What it is?
...And I said, shut up!
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
Why?
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
Where'd you get this?
Okay, okay.  I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife.
He didn't say anything?
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
Why didn't you cremate him?!
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
I'm kind of busy right now...
Look --
You need to leave.
Ed...
What's the problem here?
Maybe you should be moving on.
You're talking about my lady.
Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Look, I know I treated her bad --
I'm literally going to kill you!
Have you seen Tamara?
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
I guess not.
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.
Where did you get that alcohol?
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
I thought I told you to stay away from her.
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
I doubt very much that one even exists.
What a beautiful day.
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
You had me worried to death!
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
When did this start?
Rennie...
I heard you weren't coming.
Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly...
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
That's awful.
He carries a gun.
Shoot him.
This could be it.
This could Pbe it.
This could be it.
What about her?
She died.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
Because we're completely mismatched.
It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
She is kicking you out.
Opening night?
Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.
If you're wondering about the firearm.
See, Daddy.
What else?
I'll have whatever she's having.
Opening night, Lillian.
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
All the failures, all the fatalism.
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
Where's your elastic brace?
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
A grandmother. God bless you.
It's the kid's lucky day.
You're charming the boy.
Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
You're a family man, Frankie?
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
Then say it.
All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.
Don't worry. It's a test.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
Sidney remains optimistic.
Yes.
Yes.
There was a review.
Say it again.
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
He wears a disguise.
Home.
No one's waiting.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
I am your wife.
God gave you ten thumbs.
Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
What was he like?
Is it over if they arrest you now?
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
We need your help!
The fools!  Sorry...
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
Have you read his magazine?
Bapu, for me, and the rest,  if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there  already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
I don't understand why you were dragged out here, Sir.  It's hardly worth wasting your time--a no-nothing case like this.
Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not...  ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives.
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
What a pity.
--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
That's the last.
From what budget?
We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
Surely you know what you have.
At least it's nothing contagious.
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
You okay, Jerome?
I have to know where you come from.
You really need that much?
It's not too late to back out.
Come on--we're taking off.
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
Where are we going?
Where are you taking her?
Everybody goes there.
I have your samples ready.
Why have you done this?
Thank you.
First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?
You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--
Anything I've forgotten?
What do you think?
Vincent...Vincent...
Were <i>you</i> alone?
Why don't we say we were together?
It was a mercy-killing after all.
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
Of course I think about it every day.
What <i>is</i> this place?
--when you go away.
Jerome...never shy.  Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock.  I ever told you that, Jerome?
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
What's this, Lamar?
You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
Feel good?
It doesn't look like that.
How does it taste?
Boring.
I was going to fix you breakfast.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
He must have.
You've got it all figured.
That would be the first time.
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
You can't trust anything these days.
Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
No more about Beynon.
Sounds good.
You're crazy.
How long before this car's hot?
What now?
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
Drive.
You got it.
Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.
You can trust him...
What did he say?
A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?
Who paid you to see me off?
No, don't Jack, don't.
Where's he living these days?
Everyhing go off all right?
She's nothing to do with me.
Really.
How were things between you and Frank?
Nothing more? Just another feller?
It is. Honestly.
Do you?
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
Could you do me a favour?
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
To the demon king's castle, of course.
How'd you know where I'd be?
Who's setting you up in this place?
Is he coming here?
What does he want that bloody great country place for?
That's why you waited for me.
I want to give you an Oscar.
Tell me about the girl.
Did my brother Frank find out?
And you didn't know her last name?
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
You coming to South America?
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
Heard of a man called Thorpe?
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
I won't be using the room tonight.
Are you a traveller?
Are you awake?
Do you want breakfast?
Did you sleep well?
They're friends of mine.
What you going to do?
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
That's not always a healthy way to be...
Eh? Have a drink.
We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid.
Ask me?
Four hundred?
You ever get 'em?
We're stuck with this...
It's too...
I, I...I...
...that's right...
Shoes, boots, yes...
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."
You...
Someone should stand up and strike back.
Somebody...
Should do something to them.
We're just "talking" about it.
Did you?
You're actually talking about this?
Did I say that?
Is that what I said?
A buck a shot.
However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
He'd give me a job.
What?  What?  The leads.
You...
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
In the abstract...
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
Clear...
What.  What kind of outfit are we running where...where anyone...
Yes.
Did the leads come in yet?
Oh, God, I hate this job.
That's great.
Who used to say that?
...Come in here...I work here, I don't come in here to be mistreated...
I don't want to go to lunch.
I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to..."Call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  That's not...as long as I've...
Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.
Roma!  I'm talking to you...
You stupid fucking cunt.  You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars.  Six thousand dollars.  And one Cadillac.  That's right.  What are you going to do about it?  What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit.  Where did you learn your trade.  You stupid fucking cunt.  You idiot.  Whoever told you you could work with men?
Shelly...
What about the other two?
...no...
...no...
What is this "you say"?  A deal kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit, Williamson, shit.  You...Moss... Roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets.  Nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? Who's up there?
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
...ah, fuck this...
Why?
I will close.
Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
Is that what you're saying?
Get 'em to me!
How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.
Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me?
How do you know I made it up?
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
No.  It hadn't.
I sold them to Jerry Graff.
Five thousand.  I kept half.
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
What?
Wait...uh, look...  Look, twelve, twenty, two, twen... twenty-five hundred, it's...take it.  Take it all...  Take it!
The check's no good?
Don't.
John: John:...my daughter...
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
Get the chalk.  Get the chalk...get the chalk!  I closed 'em!  I closed the cocksucker.  Get the chalk and put me on the board.  I'm going to Hawaii!  Put me on the Cadillac board, Williamson!  Pick up the fuckin' chalk.  Eight units. Mountain View...
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...
Fuck you, Dave...
"Always be closing..."
Harriett...
And, and, and, I did it.  And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door.  But you don't know. You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.  That's all I have to say to you.
Oh, Christ.
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
I wanted to speak with you about...
My wife told me to look into...
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
Ricky, I...
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
Monday.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
When did you write the check?
And when was that check cashed?
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
No.  She told me "right now."
I can't regotiate.
What...?
What are the police doing?
Guess what the Machine did?
Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.
I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
They didn't get the contracts.
They got, listen to me...
You closed him yesterday.
Did you see my present for you?
On your pillow.
Will you take me?
You've grown so tall... so tall in the last year.  You're much taller than me.
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
Your friend lives in a fine building.
What took so long?
Do you think he'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars?  I think he would.
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas.
I want to talk to you, Michael.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
Mike, I got something special up my sleeve for these boys.  You ever hear of &quot;Superman?&quot; And I don't mean the comic book.
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.
Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
Will you tell him?
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny.  He only handles specific areas of the family business.  Tom?
If you need anything, just...
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you.  It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust.  In time, you'll understand everything.
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
And Kay...she's all right?
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
Good.  Then you're staying.
Fifteen percent skim?
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
Yeah, but don't worry.
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.
...and the tape will be running.
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
His brother came to help him.
Kay, I told you...
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game.
Not good.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
What if I say shove it?
Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.
Fuck you.
This looks corny.
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life.
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
Something I can do for you?
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
You and he are not doing things?
It's not what you think.
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
What have you done with him?
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.
These are your paintings?
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth.  Yes, my family ate dripping.  Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley.  Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone?
I liked it.  We all did.
Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend."  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer.
Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  Do you have to rub my nose in it?
The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
This was World War I?
You will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  Not this lane. Not today.
My apologies.  I had no business snapping at you.
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
Good afternoon, Clayton.
Are you enjoying yourself?
I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia.
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
Tell me something, Clayton.  Do you believe in mercy killing?
My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
So it is going to happen after all.
No.  It won't do.
I don't know.
Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far.
I can undress myself, thank you.
Where's Betty?
She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
I didn't ask George to invite you.
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?
Who was that at the door?
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "Journey's End".  Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  "Journey's End" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned.
Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- I mean badly, not baldly.  I was given the pick of stories being developed, and I picked that one.
My monsters?
How's the leg?
What are you doing here?
What about?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
It seems she neglected to mention it
Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
What's with the fish thing -- ?
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
Yeah -- ?
Jesus, man ... What'd you do?
Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
Good. Cos you know how it plays. Six years ago, I let you go free. But the next time ... The next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...
You want to come along quiet?
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
How's that?
I know you.
Not my girl anymore
I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...
What's this -- ?
What for?
Where you been, anyway?
okay ...
Diane 1.
You mean the poor --
Donny --
Forget that ...
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
What does that mean -- ?
Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
Breakfast brunch -- ?
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...
Any more ...
You all right -- ?
You sure you're okay -- ?
I heard you were pumping gas -
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
You?
What are you doing here?
Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
Too early to tell. Nervous?
Come here --
You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
Now what -- ?
What are we gonna do -- ?
He give you an advance -- ?
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
Buy you a drink?
And here I am...
What the hell are you doing -- ?
Hey.
Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was looking forward to that boost myself
She's trouble --
What the hell's that -- ?
So, you seeing anybody?
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
Let me worry about The Club ...
What are you doing... ?
I can't. I got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and I haven't slept and--  Where to -- ?
Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell?  And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?
The hard part ...
You need him...
Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now...
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...
You know what you got here?
Which way's out, man -- ?
What? What happened?
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.
What're you doing? What about the car?
Henry.  Wake up.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.
Who's gonna do that?
What are you talking about?
I flushed it down the toilet.
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
Give'm a drink.
What'll I tell Fran?
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
What happened to you?
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.
Stay there.
I hate to do dishes.
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
The third store down.
He didn't call?
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride.
Thanks, Chuck.
What?
It's a way outta here.
What class?
How'd you know where to find me?
Oh, right.
I guess so.
Is this a bad time?
Yah, that is a nice ass.
How much money you got?
You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
No, there's a limit.
Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here.
If I agree to this, I walk right now?
This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
Okay. How?
That would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, Will?
What's that?
--that?--
Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
Sean.
Hello.
My kind of background?
Can we do it at my office?
I got it.
You moved?
Seems like it's going well.
Jobs doing what?
Just...take it easy, Gerry.
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
Hello, Sean.
How about one now?
What do you want to do?
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked. What's she gonna think about us?
You're right. I know.
That's very presumptuous.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
You're getting defensive, Will.
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
Where were you?
You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
Don't give me you line of shit.
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
What?
The wrench, why?
Which one did you take, Will?
That's what you want?
I'll keep in touch.
No. Thank you.
See ya.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
You grew up around here?
'Course I do, they're my brothers.
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?
Just for fun?
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
I want you to come with me.
I know. I just do.
What about your twelve brothers?
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
Take care.
'F we're workin' for you, it's our business too. An' how do we know--  --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out?
Will ya look at her!
Ready, Pa?
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
But it ain't runnin' away, Ma. All I wanta do is go away with another fella an' look aroun' for work by ourself--
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
Maybe the road's out.
She's hotter'n a heifer.
You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face?
I didn't see nothin'.
So long.
How many men?
Women?
Open up! We hear you got a riot.
Deputy sheriffs.
No cop can come in here without a warrant.
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
Is it fur?
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?
Think she'll hold?
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
But we can still do it, honey.
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
You people got a lotta nerve.
Yes, ma'am.
What's the matter, Grampa?
How 'bout Granma?
Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
Anybody ask anything?
Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
Connie's gone.  Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.
Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.
No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
Got any more, Ma?
How's it feel, Tommy?
Looks like you done it.
That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.
They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
You can have this for ten cents.
Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.
She's jus' wore out, that's all.
Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.
Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.
Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches?
But what about this?
Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty.
Jes' like in the catalogues, ain't they!
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
You don't...
What do you do?
Marty, you haven't changed a bit!
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
Remember high school?
Bob...
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
Never better.
Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
How long has it been?
Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
He was trying to kill you, right!
Not the other way around...?
...About five years now.
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
What if I come back?
You kill people. 
What else? Say more.
You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I?
There you go. I left it blank.
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same.
Lisbon?
Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
Don't forget your identity.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
Of course you will.
God it's great to see you.
It didn't work out.
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.
So how was your first and last day of branding?
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
Thanks.
Why didn't it work out?
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
Show me again.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?
Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
No, you didn't.
You want to take your bath?  We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --
Fine!
That's not true!
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
I'll come.
Well...  So you tried riding again?
What are you talking about?
Grace, I don't hate your father.
Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing...
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.
Started what?
When? Tonight?
Why should they?
How's everything?
Great!
David?
Uh, yes... Sure, David.
I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment...  I wanted to say something...  But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter.
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
You've already made arrangements!?
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
Huh-huh. You?
You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking...
Yeah, what?
Was the trip okay?
Where to?
You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
Thank you. You're all doing too much.
What was it like?
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?
I don't believe they'll expect that.
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
I can't...
Are you afraid of anything?
I won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad... But I can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong... The same thing would have happened to me... or Frank... or Joe... And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen...  I used to try and... always came up short. I don't think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. I remember this boy I'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation. He was sixteen. Great kid. Strong. He'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. Snapped his neck, paralyzed him... After the accident, I'd look in on him from time to time... and he wasn't there anymore. His mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared. And what was left was nothing but anger... It's like the boy I knew just went away somewhere...
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
It's warmer than I thought.
I thought your mom's coming up?
Dad! I can do it, OK?!
IT WAS MY TURN!
Secret Service!
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
What's that?
Oh yeah? What's that?
Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?
Snoop onto them...
Damn!
What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?
His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
Yeah?
What are you doing?
Up all night again, huh?
How was school?
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
Crash Override.
Yo, showtime, showtime!
Here's your class.
He's not in this class.
What the hell are you doing?
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
Your slave?
We need your help.
How?
There they are!
Never fear. I is here.
Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around...
Hello?
A hacker planted the virus.
So what are we supposed to do?
What the hell was that all about?
Murphy kid turn you down?
What number please?
Purpose of visit?
I'll take you down there.
So?
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
I mean, you blew off our date at last minute.
You think she stands a chance?
Brady!
Shit!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
Mom, please
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
We should call the fire department.
Why wasn't I notified?
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
I don't want to have anyone live through that night again.
Why shouldn't I?
Has he been prepped?
I do.
Watch it.
Who you calling?
What the hell did this?
What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment.  But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.
Come on Rachel.
I thought you said you were ready.
Can we go home soon Rachel?
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
Call me.
Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back.
You look sharp. You understand?
132 to 133 this is 134.
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
You got your riot gun?
When he makes that call.
Is that him? Is that him?
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
It's over.
I know that Mr. Sayer.
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
You're going to be late!
Sure.
Well, are we still on for tonight?
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
Saving the treats for Bob?
Look.
He was standing right here.
It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
Hello?
I've already lost it.
Lies.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
What's the pumpkin for?
Fancy.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
I don't know.
Is that all you say?
We're all alone, aren't we?
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
Ten minutes.
I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
What do we do?
It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!
Well, she's totally not here.
Okay. Later.
Can we watch the monster movies?
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
Yes, I am.
What about the bogyman?
There WAS.
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
Yes, she is.
She's washing her clothes.
He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
PROBABLY going.
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
Thorazin.
I couldn't if I tried.
What did he say?
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
What are your favorite buildings, David?
Yeah.
We're a big hit.
Oh!
Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
But I'm seeing him.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
So what's the, uh, problem this time?
You know, there's no reason for panic.  I just want to rule out some things.
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
...with the affiliates.
Yes, but you name names.
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
How about you?
I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
No!  No...
How's everything?
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
Oh, you-you have that one?
Elliot!
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
This is not an easy situation.
You've been very cold to me tonight.
You bet.
I didn't say that.
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
Don't make it worse, Dad.
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
Oh, Mom!
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
Isn't it enough that I can love you?
Well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.  You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
Me?
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
Oh, yes, you have!
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
Look at this guy.
You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
Yeah.  What?
...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything.  I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything!
Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
Yeah?
Oh!
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
Ohh!
I know, I know.
You've always had good taste in husbands, so...
What are you talking about?
Hey!
You promised to stay on the wagon.
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
Perfect!
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Ohh?
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
He's such a loser!
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
Boy--
Oh, gosh.
Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
Oh, so loosely.
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
Thanks for a swell time.
Good.  How are you?
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
It was a terrible evening.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
No, the reason I ask is--
Really?
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
Really?
Oh, God!
Oh, wow!
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
It's all right.
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
Dad...
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter.  As the Soul of Man.  Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.
...very good.
Who would that be.
You want to get married...?
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
What else did I miss...?
...are they hard to get?
The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...
Agent Starling, would you come with me...?
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
He is...?
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
...here's to child abuse!
Yes, I did.
Why?
Sir:
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning. 
I'm an orphan.
Waal...
Give it up.
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
And?  Then?
I require...
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... I keep them hungry.  When... when do we think this man arrives.
Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.
I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
Can you walk?  Are your legs working...?
...I'm sorry....?
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
...might I make a suggestion...?
What's that, Baby?
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
...what...?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
Fine, thank you, but
...my love...
Because...?
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
Tell me why...?
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
Yes.
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
That if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  Why are you here...?
He was <u>shot</u>...he was shot.  On his rounds.  And... and...
And all he <u>left</u> us:  the Country brought back his <u>hat</u>, and his <u>badge</u>... both with a bullethole in them.  An' that's what he left us.  That's what I said.
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
No really, keep talking, I ree-ally want to hear what you have to say, you're just so eloquent...
It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
No.
Make it seem you have this comfortable, mysterious life and you don't give a shit whether she's a part of it. Oh, and bring up India, Talia has this obsession...  Whoa, Donald, play hard to get, not hard to want...Let Talia know that your goofy act is just something you do for the kids....
Whew, that wasn't a period. That was an exclamation mark. You know, Hayley, behind every great woman is a great first menstruation anecdote.
Freeze!  You're busted!
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
Mine!
No, they're not from Wendy.
Hello?!  What's in it for me?
That would be a No.
Don't forget, when you get home, O.B.'s. They're created by a female gynecologist.
Wendy, don't be afraid to get a little stupid and contagious. The kids don't understand that this is our summer, too. We shouldn't have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers.
I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl.
One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
You look a like you could use a friend.  You know, I'll never forget my first day at camp. Boy, I was so nervous that I...
Who wants to go tell the Anti-christ to take a "time-out?"
...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...
What in the hell did you do that for?
Yeah. I guess I do.
So this is it, anybody you don't agree about everything with can't be your friend...
When were you in Niagara Falls?
Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
Sorry Veronica.
I don't believe it. I'm winning.
Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.
Gee, thanks.
How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>.
So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
Maybe you should see a doctor.
What are you doing?
What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my...
God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.
I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
Do you take German?
It doesn't work on small animals!
Did you miss him completely?
Kurt doesn't look too good.
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
You can be so immature!
We're breaking up. I am out!
You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
You're still not listening! I'm not..
This knife is filthy.
We on tonight man?
Cool off, we're seniors.
Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert "Ram" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope.
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
What now?
I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.
wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
Come on, sit up.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
What does old Stew want?
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
That's coming along well!
Oh-what a nice outfit!
But, we're all going to Heaven!
That.
What?
You'll never guess what's happened!!
I think I'm going crazy.
Just a couple more . . .
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
Are you a dream too?
Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
What's happening to me? What are you doing?
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
Hint. It's not a geographical location.
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Pitbull attacks.
Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?
No.
Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.
So you're just packing it up just like that?
Hello I'm Dr...
Who's Allison?
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
You could say that.
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
Hey buddy!
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
Are you ready?
Wait... what the hell is this...
Last week...
You okay?
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
You got a drinking problem or what?
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.
I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.
That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man.
"Anticipation of incarceration"?
I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
I didn't even know you had a kid.
Bernie, how'sa kid?
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore.  I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here.  You got a right to throw me out.
Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
Nothin'.
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
He waited for you three hours!
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
Listen, it's important, Ev, I gotta see him, I got my reasons, very goddamn important...
My fault!  My fault!  This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault?
"Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
Instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody.  <u>You've</u> known John Bubber all your life, you're used to him, you know you're the same human being you were before all the excitement.  So you feel like a fraud...
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
That too.
He's right.  It's unprofessional.
Saving people is not our job.  It's as wrong to step in and save someone as it would be to push someone off.
Helluva story!
He lost a shoe!
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!
Oh my God!  Bernie!
LaPlante!  That asshole!  I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
Give it here, Bernard.
Was that your dad?
Where are these toys of yours?
And the rent is okay?
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
Well, can I make an appointment?
Oh, great.
Everything breaks at once.
So, you're just kind of a roving --
You must value your independence.
What happened?
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
A man?  Was it a dream?
Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
Neil -- what --
He made, you know, a remark.
How was lunch?
How was your lunch with Charlie?
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
His secretary just confirmed.
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
Let's follow 'em.
Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
Do you see a man?
And this -- is the master bedroom.
Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.
What do you think?
Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank.  Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.
She was a good woman.
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
Yes -- I think it is.
Must you do that?
The river.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
As friends -- always as friends.
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
Well?
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
Aye?
Why?
Huge.
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
If it's good advice.
You're hurt.
You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
I don't have any answers for you.
Why?
Good evening.
Let me ask you something else.  At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.
That would mean they'd been trapped in there--
Must you fight him?
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.
Fine -- I've waited over three centuries.  I can wait a little longer.
Would you care for some water, Conner?
Don't leave us, Conner.
Don't cry, wee one.  It's a better place I go to.
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't.
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
I guess so.
Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
I guess not.
What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
Who sent you?
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
I have to tell you something --
These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
You with the cops?
It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a personal secret?
You're a funny guy, Talley.
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
Give up.
The cops are comin'!
You mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
I'm scared shitless.
Ow!  Shit!
Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
Kevin left without you.
Now we can do whatever we want.
Thanks for the shirt.
What happened?
Are civilians inside?
What's going on?
I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.
That's not enough.
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.
Do it.
That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone.  What was that, son?  I didn't hear you.
He has lots of disks.
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
Did you find the disks?
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand?
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
Who are you?
You want to pay me?
Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
What is it?
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
You will tell them the truth.
I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
Satellite feed.
Very soon.
Mr. Manager.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
The fog is too heavy, sir.
You are the manager?
You have our cards.
How much?
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.
Your brother's here?
What is it, Paul.
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
What!
What's the matter?
I had you transferred to Kigali.
A car.
What does it matter.
Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
That is why they call it coach?
What do we do with all these people?
What are you doing?
Paul. Are you alright?
Paul, are you there?
For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
Why the hurry, Roger?
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
-- bullshit --
Looks like we're it.
Oh, for chrissake --
More the merrier.
Don't think it'll be a problem.
Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife.
This thing's going nowhere.
Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
Hey! Where'd you guys go?
Uhhhh...
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!
This is the best we're gonna do.
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
I'm not laughing, Steven.
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
Steven --
No...
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?
Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett?
-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
-- the window and door grates --
Fascinated.
Then tell me, please -- help me...!
Then who did??
Wish I could take the credit, but --
Don't know that it does.
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
There is something very not normal going on here!
-- Eddie!!
Did you find something?
So many unanswered questions.  Why was she buried there.  And who killed her?
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
Good-bye.
Where does this amulet come from?
Well then who did?!
It's going to hurt us!
I want this one, daddy.
Why?
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
Oh my God!  She's in there!
Good night Angel...
What the hell is that?
What is it?
It just disappeared.  Literally.
How are we doing?
You don't think I know?
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
We don't know.
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
Maura.
She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.
Your daughter's been taken.
Concentrate!  She can hear you!
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
Keep talking!
There's something in there.
There's something through that wall!
Not on station time.
I know.  I know.  But it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
Wha .... ?
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
What?
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
You gonna buy?
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
Really?
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
Eighth room down, babe...
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
"You could be swinging on a star."
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
"We all had our quarrels and parted..."
How.
Don't you just hate kids...
"Messed around" messed around?  I know-- I don't want to know.  First base?  Second Base?  Stop me when I'm getting warm...
As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.
God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
What have you been doing?
I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....
It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is....
Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou.  In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato.
I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.
Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!
Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
Get away from there, convict!
Bunny, not you too?
Don't I know you...
I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."
Thanks for sharing.
Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...
I can't believe this.  I'm in fucking Russia, or do I have to say, the fucking Soviet Union and I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.  I never thought I'd say "I'm just in this job for the money."  Sad. Any last immature quips?
We'll call it the Flying Donut!
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...
...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
I'm sure I --
Oh yes! In Muncie!
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
Oh, Norville --
You mean you know about this?
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
Muncie.
You can't print that!
Terrific.
I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
Oh, geez.
Yessir.
'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- '
...Yeah, go ahead.
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
...Well, I'm not sure where I --
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
...education, were you?
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
You're fired.
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
My God! The Bumstead contracts!
Finally.
...Enter the dame.
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
...and awduhs a light lunch.
...No money.
Maybe he's wise.
At the Houmfort.
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
Believe me, Mrs. Rand, he doesn't do this often. This is the first time I've seen him --
Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
But it's so far away...
Don't worry.  I wasn't missed.  The only important man here is the owner.
Yes, the redoubtable Paul.  He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.
But don't you have to work?
That doesn't sound like him.
Does she suffer?  Does she know what she is?
No, Wes.
Wesley can be very entertaining.
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
I've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again -- wondering what I'd feel. I could see Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, "Paul, darling..."  The whole thing beginning all over again...
You think I love Jessica and want her back. It is like you to think that -- clean, decent thinking.
You wanted to warn me...
And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
In other words, I'm on trial.
Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
Benjie!
Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
If you're going to insult me --
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
You've...
Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know --
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
Ready to go?
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --
Yeah. Well, we can just --
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
Um, Paul. On second thought, can you do me a favor and pretend I never said any of that.
Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address?
It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --
Yeah?
Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?
Huh?
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
Good-night dad.
Talking to me, dad?
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
Your toes cold?
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?
Actually it's not about work, it's advice about --
Thank you Janey.
Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
You okay?
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
I don't like coffee.
Please don't.
I'm thinking of going back to school.
Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?
You ask what the point is?
Arise and shine, young Hood.
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
No candy for me?
Just be careful.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Would it matter?  And what's that?
Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot?
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
Yeah.
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
No one.
Geometry?
It's freezing.
You have to follow me?
When worlds collide.
You get in trouble?
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
Her name's Libbets.
Is this Charles?
All my model planes.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
Just thought I'd stop by.
Want a drink?
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
I love you.
That's I.A.'s pit bull.
I want you to check this out, Ellie.
She your only sibling?
Oh, I shouldn't have...
Forget your pager?
That's right.
Where you signed this?
I wish I could stick it out like you.  I just, with Trish and the kids...
I got it.  Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years.
Fred Duggar?
"She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?
I don't know.
You want me to take you somewhere?
You and Kay were like sisters?
No...
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
What the hell do you know?
Where's your back-up?
Your lips, they didn't move.
Disappointing, isn't it? To come so far and find so little. Jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make- believe...
So you have the answers...
What are we?
I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?
But why?
I couldn't prevent it.
You didn't even warm them, did you?
You were their leader. They trusted you.
More.
But you're the fairest by far.
Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
Stop pestering me then!
Laudanum!
Why does he call you that?
You both did it?
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
Dear God, what have I done?
Read her thoughts.
You fool, what have you done?
We belong in hell.
Why do you do this Lestat?
Lestat - finish this -
Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
Lestat!
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
I have to go now Lestat...
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
You can't look at them...
You found nothing?
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
Yes.
And the child who did die?
What can I do for you?
You're in 201 and 202.
Sorry. Emergencies only.
I want off this island.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
Say yes.
No means yes.
That could break the machine.
Okay, okay. You're right.
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
You get any sleep at all?
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
Nice move.
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
Let him go. I believe him.
I know I don't want to stay in here.
There's no way to lock it.
I don't know...
Ray, I can't...
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
Don't kill me --
It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
It was one year ago...
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
What? What are you talking about? Where?
You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone.
Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.
Guess the capital of Brazil --
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?
To a great weekend --
Ahh, that feels great.
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
What's going on?
Cool.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
He complained of not feeling well. I thought he was drunk ——	he staggered.
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
I'll go up and take a look at the General —- perhaps sit with him.
The ancient Greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring Vrykolaka --
You're just talking nonsense.
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
You are fortunate in your father.
Thea, your choice is a very simple one. Either you want to claim him as your father, or you do not.
Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute.
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
Woman, what are you doing here?
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live —- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
Your daughter is ill.
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl ——
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
And I'm your friend —— but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
Theodosia --
Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn't be too angry with him, Thea. He's an old man and now with all this trouble —— the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory -- cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village.
Why in the world can't you?
Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -—
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.
What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
Well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water.
Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!
No.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
Where's Mary?
A boy?
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
You sent for me, sir?
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission –– I mean –– might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir –– and people are beginning to talk.
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
Bert, the cop, sent this over. He said to float away to Happy Land on the bubbles.
Oh –– Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.
Well?
Well, sure I do.
Hi, Daddy.
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
It will?
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.
Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?
What boat you sailing on?
Hmmm . . .
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
No . . . No . . . No. . .
Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?
You want a martini?
Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it?
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
I know, but . . .
Violet Bick!
Well, what do you know –– wife.
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
When?
Holy mackerel!
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
A new magazine! I never saw it before.
Well, hello.
Well, I don't.
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
Oh, no.
I'll take it. And then what?
How's that?
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
Where'd you get that dress?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Have fun.
Is it snowing?
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
How about that one there?
Come on, you guys.
Yeah, it's her job.
Why not?
What is it?
But the island!
We're carrying weight.
I thought you said she was going with us?
What is it?  What's there?
Good morning!
I never heard of a 908.
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
We got a helluva tide this month.
Chief?
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
Positive I.D.?
About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast....
Bartending?  I'm 17.
You stay here a minute.
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
Wait a minute....
Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
Probably.
Where the hell were you?
Do I have to talk to those two?
Where's my day book?
No.
All summer?
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
What're you going to do today?
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
What is it?  What's the matter?
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  Are they all shark victims?
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
Martin, it could be anything.
Where the hell is Air One?
Did you say Cable Junction?
Can I go with you today?
Hang on!
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
You're not going out right away, are you?
I want you to meet my cousin.
Terry!  You okay?
Me neither.
What about sailing?
Hurry, please.
Be careful....
It comes here from Cable Junction.
What's the lighthouse?
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
I don't care.
Heading back?
I don't think she's such hot stuff.
I don't need you.  Andy's here.
I want Fruit Loops!
Yeah.
And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them.
Wave to my son.
We're ready for you.
Absolutely.  Good idea.
I'll need more men to look.
What's your plan, Brody?
Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
Thank you.
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
Yeah.
Yeah, you really don't like him.
It's his work.
It's romantic down here.
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
Don't think about it.  It's over.
Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?
Fine piece of engineering.
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
You want me to stay?
Mmmm... you smell good.
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
It's too soon to move him.
Come on.
So?
What do you mean, we don't?
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
How is he?
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
I'm sorry.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
I will.
Like hell!
I want that shark alive.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
How's sleeping beauty?
Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
I think that you and I are natural enemies.
A piece of pie on Sunday.
I think they'll come out now.
I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.
Give me a ride?
'Course they're also so rich.
Well, I needed a cold shower.
This is where to be.  High and dry.
You were great out there!
Herpes?
No...  It can't be.
Take it up.
Ahhh, ahhh...
Yeah, well I didn't!
Make sure you put this back.
No, South Georgia.
The world's southern most reaches.
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Reach for the limit I always say.
I'll go with you.
What kind of trouble?
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
How'd you do in school?
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
She still talking to you?
You'll spoil her.
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....
Can I make sandwiches...?
She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
How come it's my responsibility?
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
Where's my mother?
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
Henny Youngman....
Sweet breezes...Sweet women....
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
Stop that....
I see what you're doing....
Are you all right?
The fish.  Check it....
A big one....
Don't be late.
We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....
No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
I almost forgot....
You're damn right I'm serious....
Dad died from a heart attack....
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....
Oh, it looks like my uncle's.  He taught me how to sail when I was a kid....
All you all right?
I want you to give up your work....
You could teach...You could....
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....
You hungry?
Promise me you'll be all right....
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
How can you just take the plane like this?
Our little island seems to agree with you....
I tried winter once.  Burlington, Vermont.  Flew a run to New York.  I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed.  When I was a small boy....
I could take some time off....
I borrow it without telling him....
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
Want to go for a little ride?
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Don't worry....
Grab your socks....
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
Come on, Hoagie....
Matt?
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
She has good days and bad...I don't know....
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
How many...?
I know how to tag a damn conch....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
Sharp shirt, Jake....
A regular tropo...Spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants.  You want to be a bum all your life, be my guest.  Not me.  I'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot....
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
Okay...we got it together....
You sure you've done this before?
I'm coming...How close is it?
What about Carla's gig?
You getting a reading on them?
What the hell are you doing?
All the time....
I'll do it, Jake.
It's my fault...I have to....
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
I knew there was a reason I could afford this.  To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful....
Did you like that, Mama?
I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?
I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..
Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?
So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?
There's nothing in the files?
He thinks you stole his promotion.  What exactly you doin there, John?
You gotta stop smoking ..
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
Because I dislike her too much ..
Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something ..
We're going.
What do you want it for?
I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
Did he shut you down?
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
Ease off, John ..
Jesus. What are you doin?
Now?
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
What do you want me to do, Chief?
She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
Did he get you the job?
.. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..
Vehicle references.
His blind friend got "attacked." Angelo went up there, and some- how, it got itself in the paper.
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
So read it! You just hung a target around her neck!
Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
You don't know what you done, Taylor.
As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
Did Amber have a dog?
No.
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
Are you married?
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing?
Just your age.
You know? How do you know?
You're looking worried again, Helena?
The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..
I think they're gonna arrest me.
Why?
You got a warrant for this?
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
When did John divorce?
You think he still loves her?
Is that Margie?
I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
Who told you?
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
This can't be happening to me.
I just heard.
I have to finish my job --
Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty..
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
Reporters, Jerry.  They been callin' all night.
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
No no...
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Too bad.
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
Me too.
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
Well -- this would be goodnight.
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
Sure you're okay to drive this?
If I said that, would you stay?
I don't need you to "stick."
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me.
What about medical?
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
I heard.
No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.
I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
Oh, thank you.
Denver is where he should be.
Not right now, Jerry.
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
Rod --
Is that your porty or mine?
You're telling me to dance.
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
If you get injured, you get nothing.
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed.
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
I'm sorry I asked.
I don't want to be friends anymore.
You're with the sports people on the plane, right?
Gorgeous.
Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --
How can I make your life better?
Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
... dick?
You wanted smaller.
Jerry --
He should have kept his head tucked down.
ERRR-IIIC!
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
Oh, my God.
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
Her new boyfriend.
How much weight have you lost?
You hate to swim.
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
Well what?
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
Eric!
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
That does sound lucky.
Is it a rex?
How would you classify it?
They never got that big.
Anything good?
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
Found this, but the battery's dead.
Did you read Malcolm's book?
Know what this is?
We're safe!
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
What the hell is going on? What are they doing?
No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
Amanda!
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
Is there an antidote?
Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
I'm not going, John.
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
I could come with you.
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
What kind of gun is that?
What in Christ's name is going on?!
Where's the power and radio setup?
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
Their what?
What?
She's gutty.
Lava?
You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:
We have to send someone to look for him!
Ask her.
Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
They are?  I'll be damned.
Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
Carousel.
Once we have control again we - -
The taphonomy sure looks that way.
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
Why would they care what we think?
The movement!
Oh, shit.
Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
Dr. Grant!
Do you see anything?
No. We can't.
It's all right.
You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos.
Uh - - thumb!  The same way.
Unpredictability....
Can we chance moving him?
Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.
If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
Why not?
Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
You're married?
Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
Tim!  Lex!
Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!
I like cows.
Your silence intrigues me.
You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
Jump, Timmy!  It's too late!
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
Mister Biller?
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
What's going on?
What happened?
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
Sorry.
Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.
Well?
Oh?
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
Oh?
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
Add it to the list.
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
We're down to seven minutes.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this.
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
A true friend would do it.
Did you see him?
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
You wanted to see me, sir.
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
What's funny?
How long were you and Eduard --
Are you free tonight?
Eduard wanted to marry me.
They're not obliged to tell.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
Was he depressed?
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
He can't sit still.  Just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one.
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -
Holy God! The mummy walks!
Where do I charter a boat?
Can you fly?
I can't imagine you crying.
There's a light up ahead.
Jack!
Barricade the gates! Quick!
You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!
Tell me Mr Ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
Did you see her?
Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!
Honey, a couple of years ago, with Jane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a Dumper --
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
Enjoy.  Well --
Mm.
I do not love him.
All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
Oh no, I don't think --
Who?
Gee.
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --
Is there anything more I could --
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
The same as Jane McKenna.
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
I called Trina.
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
Where, how?
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
You were hired to look for Tom.
I can't follow you.
I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man?
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
Not unusual.
About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
I know Tom Grunemann.
No.
Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here.
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
Does that distress you?
What do you have here, Billy?
Greatest.
On earth.
Uh, huh...
You're late.
All it is is onions and gravy.
I want a pizza.
I'm sorry...
Daddy?
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.
Wow!
Was there apple juice when you were little?
Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  I needed to talk to somebody.  I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what.  But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  He became very...I don't know, very threatened.  I mean, when- ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  Anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self- esteem...  At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person.  And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.
Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
And how did you find his work?
Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
Did he ever fail to provide for you?
Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?
How long was that?
Were you?
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
Hello, Ted.  You look well.
He looks like a terrific kid.
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought--
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
All right, Jim.  You said I was running this show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right?  Well what the hell is this? What's going on, Jim?
And?
O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
How should I know?
So...what's so terrible about that?
It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ..."like" you a lot.  And you...  ..."like" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
Three months.  How can you tell?
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
That's if we win.  If we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.
Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child.
Oh, Christ!
I'll take my chances.
Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
Now, I'd advise you to wait outside.  It'll be eas--
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything.   Pow she's out the door.
Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--
Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
Huh.. .Hello?
I worry about them.
I do, now.
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
Dalai Lama.
Holiness?
Your father had been very sick.
Me. First break of day.
I will be back in a few days.
This many?
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
How big is Tibet's army?
Is that big?
Tell me.
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
Do you think I must?
I have more men.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
You must study very hard, do not neglect the holy things during this time.
Tell me.
The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.
If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
Did you love your husband, before you married?
You killed him.
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
And what would he do come winter?
Around here.  Yeah.
We'd only just met.
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
I do <u>not</u> like you.
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
Was he a good man?
This is a setback.
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
He was an Indo-pacific.
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.
And how would we neutralize him?
I'm okay.
Why are you here?  Really.
If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
Baby crocs?
You flew up here because your boss--
Okay.  We're up at six.
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
Thing we can lift it?
I'm not mushing it.
Really--
He's mooing.
Hector!!
Well...
You think?
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
I'm ready when you are.
Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
Get back from the shore.  We know how fast he can leap out.
He's done.  He's dying.
Thanks for your help.
Yes.
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
What?
They don't believe her.
Hank!
What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
Kelly.
Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, <u>you</u>... you're y'know...
Hey.
This is what we do?
Are you on drugs?
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.
Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you.
You're out of line, Starling, and you're off this case. Back to Quantico.
Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.
But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?
Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.
If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone.
Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
It's much better than your shoes.
I have no doubt of it.
Reasonably so. Yes.
Your bleeding has stopped.
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
Ahhh... Why?
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
Go, Doctor.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
On what basis would they reject him?
That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?
No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.
No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
Where were you going?
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
Your "father"?
He did?
You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...
Will you go back to England?
What?
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
Yes. Go ahead.
How far is it, scout?
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!
That is the truth!
Head for... for the white water.
I don't understand!
What did you say?
Will you men help us stop the French?
Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
What happened to you?
What a place for them...
Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.
I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
Right - about face! March! First rank present!
Yes.
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
Their arms?
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
And?
Why Sixpack?
DeJesus!  A readout!
Doc eat already?
It's got Hazy!
I thought they were your friends?
Jesus Christ...
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
Look at my foot, sir!  This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
I need more light on that, Four.
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
What are you doing?
The internal monitors read normal.
Something wrong, Cobb?
Charge set?
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
Thank you, Martin.
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
Who else...Sixpack.
Yes sir...
Still bothering you?
Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.
"Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!
It's Sixpack!
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
What is it?
The shack...
Are you sure you saw something?
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
How much did you part with?
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.
Because it's cheap like a budgie.
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
Bacon, see what we got.
I don't know what you mean.
You fucking well have to get 'em!
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
Son?
You all right back there, mate?
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
Is he on his own?
What can I do for you?
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
Who was that?
Jesus, I have heard about him.
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
Dog, I have found the cash!
What's that idiot doing next door?  We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?
It must be this one.
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
J, what's going on out there?  Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
And look what happened to that.
You what? What are you on about?
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
Who's this fat man, then?
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
Well, what did he say?
You got it all?
You must be Eddy. JD's son.
That's if I want to see you.
And?
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
Look. Go on, look.
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
How many feet?
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
That makes it okay?
How do you think you're going to make a living?
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
Who's "they"?
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
You're dismissed.
We're not running a dating service here.
Nice job.
A .45--
What's that for?
So?
Whole different story; isn't it?
You still going to all the home games?
Suppose not.
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
Hey, it's the General.
Uncle Al--
You weren't in here tonight, were you?
Same as they done in Mexico.
They were in the Army. Like your father.
So I'm part-Indian?
Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.
This place is a gold mine.
What?
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
Mikey look at this--
This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber--
We been through this before--
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]

In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
Charley Wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground, and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him.
Your mother was a saint.
Historic occasion, isn't it?
That so?
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
Fellas.
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
We're building up tourism, Sam--
There was a mandate in the last election--
Steve called for you.
He had the club out on the old trail road--
You had to deal with him in running the club.
And my father?
No. Is he sick?
I don't think you can take it personally--
Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope.
What about it?
You gonna stay out here?
You got in late last night.
Can I get this?
How come?
Three months.
Murdered him?
Field trip?
No--
I mean what did we know about anything?
How long have you lived here?
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
You think we need a new jail?
Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.
Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
I know you?
Otis what?
As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?
How come you don't took familiar?
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
That's Butterfield...
Who did this?
I don't want him getting in the way.
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
Death.
Please.
If you've lied to me to me --
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?
Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
Do you wish him to be amongst us?
Will you come to him on your knees?
He's with us...
And are you afraid?
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
Sorry.  You asked.
So why did you marry him?
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
What was that?
Oh God!
Don't look.
Harry?
... they believe you.
Sure.
Oh God.
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
And this Butterfield guy--
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
What are you, my mother?
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
Harry D'Amour.
Are they all in the business?
That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
How the fuck do you do that?
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
So Nix won't come looking for her?
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
They got here before us.
He did something with the ground.
Can you do it?
Yes! Yes!
You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Try twenty-five.
I'm thinking about it.
Hi again, how's it going?
Not really. How long are you here for?
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob — Charlie Brown.
Hello?
Of course.
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
Really?
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
And marriage, does that get easier?
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
Do you know where we are?
Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to miss you.
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
Like Japanese food.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
Hello?
Hospital?
See you later.
Its bad for you.
Oh, the record company sent these...
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
It's amazing  there!
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?
She's been stalking you, Peter.
Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?
...you wearing a watch, Father?
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
Why are you doing this to me?
Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.
So...we won?
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
Well I know he's come here before.
Yes... and you are?
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
What do you mean?
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
What?!?!
You should think about getting professional help.
We needed to know all we could.
Nothing yet.
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
What do you mean?
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
He was trying to tell me something.
Maya?  What do you mean?
But she worships you.  Your mother's dead but your father's alive.
You know what?  You can go.
Yeah.
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.
What's up?
That's not funny
Monica.  What are you doing here?
Hi.
Engaged.
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
There you go.
So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
Coach...
You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.
So how long is this trip?
Nah.
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
That too tight?
This brother from my college.
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
Thanks, Sidra.
But?
I know.
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
I don't know.  A lot.
What do I have to do?
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
I think we gotta kiss now.
And?
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
Early night for you, isn't it?
Four.
When'd you get this?
You finish the reading for E-con?
I can't help girls coming up to me.
Then prove her wrong.
That was so weak.
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
Hey.
I've been trying to find you all day.
Sorry about your game.
You want to go talk?
You weren't at my game.
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
Least she had time for me.
Never had to.
How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.
Funny.  I never did.
Who's this guy I always see her around?
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
It just isn't.
Like what?
What's going on?
You're out of your mind.
Hey, girl.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
Give it yourself.
Not great.
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
Quincy, please...
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
Still is, so let yourself out.
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
Lucky kid.
And some things should never fucking happen!
I ain't a damn liar.
Look, I'm busy.
Call 911. Call 911 right now.
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
What kind of Cancer?
...what the fuck is this...?
Honey.
No.
What are you lookin' for?
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.
This is my job.
Please, yes.
No.
Why not?
-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
It's fine.
-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
Yeah.
Say what you want and you'll see --
....now that I've met you.... Would you object to never seeing me again?
Let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please.
No, what's wrong?
What's your name?
Have you ever been there?
C'mon guys, settle down --
Not enough, what do you want?
What do you mean, "like what?" -- you could get endorsments and shit --
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY MAN.
BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT DAD WE GOTTA GET HIS MONEY --
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
DAD --
How much you pay me for my help?
Ok. Listen. You: c'mere.
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
Things go round 'n round, don't they?
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me --
What is that?
I've been a good worker --
He has Phil right now.
How's today then?
...ah...
Time lines, y'know?  I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?
...cocksucker....
This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:
She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
Hello?
All it takes is one second?
I'm gonna start rolling --
This isn't meant --
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
She does.  From when you were a boy.
She lived in Tarzana.
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
Where are you from originally?
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
I wouldn'tve asked --
It's not your given name, right?
Are you asking me a question?
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
Is he in pain?
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
I don't have to answer your questions.
I don't know a loud crash.
Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
Willa Cather.
I'm gonna need a full name, Stanley.
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.
Come home soon after the show.
How do we do this, then?
The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
Was there anyone that I know?
Just once.
I think that you know.
...say it, Jimmy...
She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
Jimmy, did you touch her?
...Jimmy...
You're Jimmy Gator, right?
Do you still have to do homework?
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
I can't.
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
Let me call you a car, Linda.
You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of <u>my</u> family. this is the <u>family</u>, <u>me</u> and <u>him</u> do you understand?  You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.  That man, his son does not exist.  HE IS DEAD.  HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?
Hello.
You been on Prozac long?  Dexadrine?
You motherfucker...you motherfucker.... YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
mmm.hmm.
I don't have regular classes anymore.
Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?
I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.
I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
You ready to keep winning?
Why didn't you answer those questions?
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
Are we gonna keep going with this game?
You have to be nicer to me, Dad.
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --
...what...?
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
How can I serve you in this?
Your Majesty...
What do you propose to do?
What are they doing?
What is that?
Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
More wine!!
Three days.
Where are you going?!
But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
A simple theological discussion.
I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
And why are you so glum?
Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
But why?
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
Die?  What...?
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
I heard your playing.
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
What is that?
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
One for all.  All for one.
A personal nature?
I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!
Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.
Where is Michelle?
Continue.
Food, moron.
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
From Raoul.  He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.
Captain Doyle?
Alright, we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
It's Marvosa -
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
Yeah?
We're by Ozone...
You can cut the shit, asshole--
Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!
Did you hit him?
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
Well don't you think that's odd?
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
Alright, where is she?
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
Yeah?
What?  Wait a minute -
Captain?
Where up north?
No...
What exactly did you see?
Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
Jesus, man...
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
Are you going to be alright?
Are you a regular there?
You don't seem afraid of much.
Long gone, huh?
Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.
Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
Where?
We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
Who did he ask for?
Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
Will?
It's getting late and...
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?
The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?
That was nice of you to think of that.
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
No. Reba...?
Who?
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
Do you feel privileged?
Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?
'No' what?
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
Do you have it?
She'll be in, in the morning...
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
Do you know something about that?
He's misunderstood.
He's very strong physically.
I don't want to do that,
Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
What happened to them?
No.
Me, too. And very erotic...
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Blue is cold.
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
Do you remember what you said?
Can you quit?
What will you do?
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
That's right.
Will it keep them out?
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
Yes.
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
Why should I tell you?
Pray tell.
What disadvantage?
What were the yards like?
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
May I keep the file?
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will.
I don't believe in God.
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
You have to do it.
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy.
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
Really?
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
How can you be so casual??!
GET OFF!
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
This is great.  The crowd's gonna love this!  Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?
Excuse me, Andy...
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.
So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you.
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
Then the informant is real.
The sewers.  Of course.
Weird.
That's the third white van I've seen.
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
You weren't supposed to relieve me.
You don't, do you?
He had an accident.
You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
... yes.
Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
Give me your phone.
How long?
Hello?
The cubicle across from you is empty.
Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
Why do my eyes hurt?
Get some rest.  You're going to need it.
I thought it wasn't real.
Do you understand, Neo?
The beginning?
Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
Got it.
Tank.
We need an exit.
Tank, charge the E.M.P.
Hello?
Hello, Neo.
My name is Trinity.
How did you do that?
Who is?
Uh-oh...
Get this thing out of me!
E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.
What are you doing?
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
No, you... have to be.
What?
No one has ever done anything like this.
Are you all right?
Where is it?
How much time?
Why?
Operator.
It's locked.
Operator.
What are your plans?
No, all we got is $40.
Sssh!  Quiet.  Y'know that's illegal.
Well, we want good stuff.
Hey hold it!  Gimmie the cash.
'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
Look at her.
Nervous?
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools.  Palm trees.  Girls in little French bathing suits.
Waddaya think?
Drinks for everybody Tony...
What happened to you Flash?
I know but let's hear it anyway.
Nah.
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know...right?
Keep your mouth shut.
Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!
Oh, cut it out, will ya?
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
Back so soon.
This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
What are you going to do?  Hide me?
Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing.  There is nothing to give him.  No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
Nope...
Oh Michael, look...
He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
Uncle, how are you feeling?
Hey, where you been?
I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
No.
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
It's still sick.
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
You know why...with my parents.
The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
Scumbag--
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
Come on.
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.
How much?
Can you spare it?
Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --
That's your name?
Dinner?  Again?
That was 'Joe'.
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
Oh, the goddam party --
I wasn't going to say --
Honey, please.
Paillarde of veal.
Yeah, but --
What do you do that for?
Yes, sir?
'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.  You like it?
Toast?  No...just the butter.
-- Did I hear 'business'?
...See you tomorrow night.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.
Hot or cold.
No, I don't --
'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
'Yes'.
I was saying to Quince we won't need --
It's going to be great --
I'm all excited --
Is there any more to it?
You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"?
Shall we adjourn?
Why?
Whose?
That's it?
I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.
Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited.  So what do you think, is it --  -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?
...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.
He said that?
Doctor lady make it irey.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
My Doctor Lady?
Yah.
Jennifer.
The Board is waiting.
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
Don't bother asking, we already tried.
C'mon, have a drink.  You look like you need one bad as me.
I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
What are you doing here?
'Big'?
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
I've got plenty of friends.
Susan?
Whatever you do.
Joe, I'm with Drew.
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
No.
I love your smell.
Thank you.
-- Could you?
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
Did you like making love to me?
I like you in a black tie.
I believe that, don't you?
You think so?
What a good idea.
Good morning.
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
There's one to every rule.
-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time --
Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
Okay.
I'm sorry, Bill --
I couldn't sleep.
'Spooning'?
Thanks.
What the hell do you care?
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
He is --
Yes.
That's me.
Excuse me?  Could I say something?
I didn't ask any question.
Are you giving me orders?
The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
I'm sorry --
How're you doing--?
No, anything is possible.  It's up to Joe.
This one.
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
Drew's aboard?
Drew told me.
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
Aw, you're tough.
I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.
Are you okay?
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
It'll come back, Daddy.
Where's Joe?
Where is he?
Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
But what?
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
Not at all.
...It's kind of a pro bono job.
38.

MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 85.

Slam it?
What makes you think he's my friend?
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
I like your car.
Where'd you get it?
I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.
Why?
You don't remember me.
So I just take your word?
What?
Such as?
Your wife?
Who?
I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
My wife used to call me Lenny.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
Why would you do that?
What's wrong?
What does he want?
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
* Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -			*
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
Dying.
Beer, please.
My name's Leonard.							 *
Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
Shut your mouth!
Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back?
Guess I've told you about my condition.
It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
Who?
Why?
We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
She couldn't.
She has no idea who I am.
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
What's wrong?
He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you?
So who are you saying he was?					*
Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
With Sonny.  110%.
They'll kill Gina.
...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...
Yeah?
We're not certain...
I don't know.
So...?
There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
What do you like to drink?
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
Were you born in Havana?
How's he not your husband?
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Is it December?
I forgot the napkins.
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
Yero, by himself?
Yeah.
Packaging?
Yeah?
You got something to say, José, let's hear it.
And there's Dmitri...
Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
So?
Then it don't work.
They watching us watching them watching us waiting for them?  Or what?
To the limit.
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
Where'd you go?
Verdado where?
Hey, fuck him.
Eleven to seven he blows it.
Go ahead.
Hello?
Never heard of him.
Who said, "go exploring"?  We want this staying on track.
I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.
Oh, good...
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
What flowers?
Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.
Why?
I think José suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...
I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
Equipment?
They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if...
Yeah?
Must be some mess back there.
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
He's got taxi fare.
You think I'm lying!
Okay. Never argue with a man.
For money.
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
You don't seem like no fag...
You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea?
I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited you, didn't I?
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.
Where'd that come from?
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
Keep the goddam blanket on.
You're what?
I'm falling apart, that's funny?
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
Getchmis olsun
Yeah.
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it.
Yes.  I think so.
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
...are you with the Consulate?
What's your father do?
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months...
Hello, Billy.
Get the... midnight... express.
Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
You got your stuff?
What time is it?
What?
Whose?
Hishradyo.
You're ayip!
Know what?
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
His name?
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.
There's really people living down here?
And a right.
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
Did you see the size of that thing?!
What?
I only got...
You feel anything?
Can we get this car there?
What are you doing down here?
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
What are you putting that crap on me for?
He didn't do it!
Just inner chambers...
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
A shame.  You looked great tonight.
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
Metaxonycha Godmani.
You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?
He was just doing his job.
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
C'mon...
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
What?
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
Here.
You're very kind...
What's it about?
But what?
I can take it, go ahead.
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
Done?
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
You want me to burn my book?
You want me to burn my book?
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
Set what up?
Misery's Return?
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do?
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.
What things?
Did I do good?
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
Yes.
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
Hey, Pete.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?
Where is it?
Not much luggage.
How grateful?
How I usually find you, Nyah.
To win?
Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.
Sort it all out.
Fight a bit of a cold..
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
She doesn't belong here, Sean.  Let her go.
Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.
Before we kill her or cure her..
There she is.  I got visual.
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
What can we do' mate?
Do you know me?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Where's the bloody -
Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
What's you name?
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
And that's the only reason?
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
Before you are.
Where do I meet you?
I managed.
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
No.
No.  Should I?
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
What did you think of him?
Excuse me?
Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
Luther, I'm looking at security.
Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left?
You have Bellerophon.
To friends.
Donít Jim.
Krieger can get it.  Right?
Did we get it?
I'm walking.
You were in the car!
Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.
There was nobody on the bridge.
What?
Did they send you...Did they send you?
Why haven't they brought us in yet?
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
May I come in?
It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
Okay...
Two cars.  Where are you?
Whoís dead?
No sir.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
What kind?
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
How will you make sure Job will be there?
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít prelude a meeting in private.
Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
IMF mainframe.
In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
Would you remove your hat please?
Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
I thought I'd take some now.
Oh?  What's the problem?
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
Sure.  If the main character does.
Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
Abort.  Thatís an order.
Where are you?
Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?
Jim...?
You got it.
Jim, itís over.
Why don't you take a look?
Such a nice ass.
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Whatís the problem.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
The Shawfish?
Are you ready?
Where you been?
Cosmo?
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
You're not sleepy?
Here.  Ti amo. 
I'm getting married.
Yeah.
The guy died.
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
Mona?
You're my father.
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
Oh, Cosmo!
Why didn't he call himself?
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
How'd he die?
Why?
You don't know nothing about it.
What are you doing!
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
Loretta.
What about Johnny?
Oh my God.
I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
I'm marrying your brother!
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
What did I do?
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
Why not?
Snap out of it!
What are you talking about?
Who painted that?
What do you want to do now?
You're making me feel guilty again.
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
Let me go home.
I'm freezing to death.
Ronny!
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
You never have dessert.
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
I like this ring.
I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.
I have no secrets from my family.
And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
So we'll sell the house.
Do you love him, Loretta?
I know.
No idea.
May I presume to ask you a question?
Thanks, comrade.
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
Sorry. That was rude.
Yes.
Nerves.
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
May I walk with you a ways?
I'm a little cold.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
Look.
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
She's got it.
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
Oh!
All right!  What do you want?
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
None shall pass.
You're a liar.
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
Are you sure he's got one?
Ni!
There!  Look!
What?
Who are they?
What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
What?
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
Too late.
Behind the rabbit?
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
The nose?
What is your quest?
Well taken, Concorde!
I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
Do you want to come and have a drink?
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
I don't want land.
But, Father.
Leaving the room ... yes.
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
Right.
We are just not used to handsome knights ...  But you are wounded!
Camelot ...
Well, she's got a point.
No look, really, this isn't nescess ...
No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
Well ... yes ...
I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.
I done it again.
So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.
And she sent no word down?
She'll get over it.
She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
You should have someone look after you.
It's what the maids are for.
Checked and locked, sir.
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
Gesture?
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
By whose authority?
What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised!
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth.
What do you know about the Highlands?
Do you hunt?
Oh.
Surely --
And the pony?
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
Those, over there, there.
I am told so.
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
We took a nip of whiskey.
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
Well, both.
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
Why was I not informed?
It's Mr Brown, ma'am.
Unwell?
Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
There is one other matter.
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
What do they want?
Where is my son?
Then why are you not with him?
Does that thing work?
What's the riddle?
Dead?
Maybe he's not dead.
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
He thinks I'm "sublimating".
Sick?
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In here".
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.
You mean we learn the rules...
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
You feel it?  It's different this time.
Our time's up.
What the fuck is that?!
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
Which way?
What did he do to you?
Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!
I'm thinking!
They fired everyone.
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!
Someone's shut off my money!
And?
It's been a very strange day.
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
Yes...what is it?
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
Wow!
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
You're really something Coco...thank you.
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
There was an accident. I came here.
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
My name is Rita.
Betty Elms?
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
Hi.
No, no, I'm fine.
Can you tell me what happened?
Was anyone hurt?
No ..........I.
I think I've been hurt.
Mulholland Drive.
No.... I don't...
It's not my voice ... but I know her.
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
Those men in front, in the car.
To my audition.
Betty Elms.
Yeah, what for?
I had a dream about this place.
Yeah, they showed me
Nice wallets.
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
Hardly.
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
Where are we ?
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
There's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air. It won't kill you, but it will hurt.
McCay knows ?
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
It won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.
He hired you to build this place ?
I... I .....
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
What are you DOING here ?
That was eleven years ago.
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
Is it over ?
What's next Walt ?
Be very, very quiet...
Hey, try swimming. It works.
He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.
Don't.
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
Stop the hydraulics.
When I think you're ready.
Trust is earned not given away.
I made my bones on the street, you know. I did Riglioni in his own house. I was made in the Family, okay.
He already had a balance of $600,000.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
Any priors ? Any police record ?
Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
Is it as good as I hope it is ?
One moment dear... 
No. I was just curious if what I heard about you is true ?
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
Are you happy with your salary and position ?
So who are these people with the Boss ?
What is Bruce doing ?
Will he make it out ?
Maybe you should get over fears.
So what's next ? No one's ever made it this far before.
What the ... ?
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
Are you okay ?
Not now, Mom.
I'm talking to you asshole !
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
You had to remind me?
I don't think you're very polite.
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
So you're saying...What are you saying??
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
Hi honey.
Totally.
What happened to Shelly?
Well you should at least try a little bit.
I don't know if I want to.
Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading.
Reason? What reason?
I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
See you? He can smell you from there.
What's the matter?
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
Then what did she do?
Hello.
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
I guess you have.
He's writing. Hello?
Thanks
But we made a business deal.
Don't wake up Vada.
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
He said it was a gift.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
Getting off please.
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
You ratted on my mother??
Care for a smoke?
Boy, you're really into this.
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Boyfriend?
Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
Just come and get it...right here!
...I dropped it.
You mean,  this ring?
What's he smoking?
Hey look!
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
An adventure?
But...are you engaged or something?
Committed?
I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
He was caressing.
God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke God Rose, because he saw even more than I did. ROSE Look Phil, if you want the rights of a husband, you're gonna have to ask me something but if not, you're gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are.
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?
I'm just tired.
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
Shelly?
He's so tiny.
Let me hold him.
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
The boss is watching us...
Can't you see it?
It's still available I hope?
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
They're dead?
Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
You don't like it?
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
Kiss me.
Goodnight Shelly.
Shelly?
Watch you don't knock out a fish.
I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.
Vada, we're trying to work here.
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
She likes to play bingo.
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
When?
I like the freak show.
We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
What are you doing.
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
Well well well, what's going on in here?
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
Please.
No....
I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
What are they about?
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
Sure.
Are you going out somewhere?
The boys at school don't think I am.
Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
I like my name.
Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
I'm hemorrhaging.
How old are you?
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
Thomas J?
No, I'm going home.
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
Who's that with your Dad?
What do you think it's like?
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
Here.
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
Woah!!
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Close your eyes.
What?
You don't miss much.
Needs salt.
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
He can't do that to me!
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
Neosporin?
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Needing.
Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning.  Brevity is even more in order than usual.
All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
How about...
But he sure can kiss.
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
About Michael's job.
But he always says...
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
Ex-cuse me?
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
Waiter! Check, please!
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
Where did we first hear th...
Will she like it?
I'm up against a deadline.
Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?
This thing means that much to y...
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something...
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
I asked you...
What's up?
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
Because I could come...
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
You got the money?
No.
I called Connie and she said not to worry, She'll fill in for you.
Barnett, please -
Then why are you listening to her -
You have to what?
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.
I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
What do you really want?
She's fine.
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
He has that sign with the tree.
Okay, then we'll see you there.
What's he running for?
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
Yes, but we're just singing.
He saw us at Tammany Hall.
Sorry to bother you, Bud.
Need to have you check these out before he goes on that Walker benefit.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
Do you know Barbara Jean?
Haven's not going to talk to me.
Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant.
You got a place to stay?
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
Weather's been awful. All those bombs dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days.
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Yes.
I'd really like to see you.
Oh.
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
You know who that is?
They said go see the chaplain.
Yes.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Hello. John Triplette.
An album.
How's your stomach?
We just got a gold record.
No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
The architect  His buildings are drippy. You know, like sand and castles. Then I got this assignment. They want to start in two weeks.
Pleasure
Oh --
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Southern California.
Ah... Peter Finch.
Peter Finch -- he's English.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
Got me an audition tonight.
You sure do it loud.
It's not bad.
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.
Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work?
Mickey!
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.
You're a breathing icon of justice and that's why you were chosen to deliver Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison board we, knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen, an escape attempt, an accident, fire, anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti would be there to look out for his public's best interests.
...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?
How come you never talk?
The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.
What I'd like to do---
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
Not to anybody. She sings.
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
Tell me about the purity.
Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The cops, my mom, everybody. But you see, they all missed the point of the story. I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding the shotgun, it all became clear. I realized for the first time my one true calling in life. I'm a natural born killer.
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
...developed between the three of us. We're kindda in this together, don't ya think?
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
I admire them.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Yes.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
How immediate is immediately?
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.
Roger?
Are you all set?
Waitin' in the lounge.
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
Okay, boys, let's have it.
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
I see.
Ya know, I was.
Who's going to buy me a beer?
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
Want to keep your job, boy?
I said: Cut it out!
Walker and Williams.
What d'you want?
Looks like you're doin' a good job.
Don't say much, do you?
And his age?
You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.
How 'you doin' man?
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
Haven't seen you around, have I?
Oh yeah?
In Birmingham.
Your folks live there?
That's right.
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
They must work on the section gang.
How come you stay 'round here?
Yeah. Well, I do.
How old is your boy?
Hi.
What about him?
What about them?
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
How come you keep askin'?
Don't, Duff.
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
No point fixin' it!
Don't do that!
What's so hot 'round town?
Just get her drunk.
A whole lot, Frankie.
'You Will Anderson?
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Going back, huh?
Hello.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
So you're courtin' the preacher's girl. Well, just watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you right into hell.  I'm counting on you, Reverend.
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
Let's stay here, Will.
Better now.  Where 'you at?
I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.
Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
We got any shots?
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
What you lookin' for, mon?
Easy...
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
Alright. Let's talk business.
Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
And then?
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
Yeah, well it's working.
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
She's ready to go.
Who got you into this?
Yo.
Doesn't look like much, but that's King Hell ice, man. Fry your brain out soon as look at you.
Bright enough to be dangerous.
He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
How much time you got left?
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
You haven't got it?
You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
Want to fucking answer them?
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
Maybe something's onto him.
I'm going in.
You okay?
It sounds like you.
Yeah... fine.
Case... Are you alright?
I know.
Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
Shit...
Who?
Like what?
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
: Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
What is with this school and prom?
What's that?
What?
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
Okay. That's bad.
Cuuuute!
George! What are you doing here?
wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.
You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
He is totally crunching on you.
Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
You've done five of my ideas.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.
This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!
Do you even know these kids?
Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
What if I say no?
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
Better person than I.
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
Wow. This must be big.
No, I mean, no big whoop.
You're twenty-three years old!
Whoa. Deja Vu.
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
This seat taken?
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
Yoooooow.
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
I don't know.
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
He <u>has</u> to know...
Not at all!
Yes.
That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
Taste it.
Taste it.
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
<i>                                          ... You're no fun.</i>
You set this all up, didn't you?  One of your sick jokes?
Come back here!
I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
So, what about you and that Poletti girl?
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
You remember your dreams, Grady?
You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.
You're fucked in the head.
You okay?
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
You know her?
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.
What about "essential energy" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
What is this place?
Disappointed?
Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic?
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.
Who, Jesse?
Maybe we should call a doctor.
What's that?
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
Girl, what are you doing?
I know who's trying to kill you.
You like gymnastics?
Nancy!
So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker.
Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.
Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.
Well, if it isn't my little girl... come to visit her Daddy.
Fred Krueger's dead.  You always had a little trouble understanding that, Princess.
Ms. Thompson.
I'm serious.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
Then maybe you're ready.
What are we going to do?
You're not going in.  That's exactly what he wants.  As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.
Nancy...
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself.
I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...
Lovely to meet you.
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
No!
God, that's an enormous arse.
So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?
And then I... right.
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
Oh Jesus.
Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
Okay -- fine.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
Okay.
Too complicated.
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
Why?
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
Eleven.
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
Wow.
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
How are you doing?
That's not true.
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
This is certainly... ah...
You were saying...
... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
That's right.
Bella -- this is Anna.
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
Bloody hell, this is fun.
Bernie -- this is Anna.
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
Da Vinci?
By the way -- it's you.
What happened?
Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
Are you a fan of Henry James?
Well, fire away.
Right -- want another one?
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
So -- you've laid the ghost.
Hello.
Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
Try 'Flintstone.'
Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?
Spike.
Maybe.
Yes.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Are you sure you...?
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
But you have no proof.
N-n-n-n-duh-duh-duh-pl-pl-pl-pl-muh muh-muh...
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...
That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it?  You must try to talk about it, Billy.
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.
Gotta go now, ma'am...
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!
What's your name, buddy?
Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us!
So long, kid.
What is it, kid?
I-I-I-I-I'll g-g-g-go, M-M-Mack...
Ahhh, Billy...
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
In there.
Go with him, Rose. Go with him.
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
Let's go, for Christsakes...
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
There they are!
Yeah, where we going?
Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
I'll bet a dollar.
Yeah, my feet are cold...
Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
Giving up?
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
What's your plan, Mack?
Time in!  Hold it! Time out!  I said Harding out!
I said out!
I'm the coach!
Who told you that?
I wanna go home!
To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure...
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
When?
Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning...
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
Yeah, buddy?
What's troubling ya, buddy?
Yeah, take us back to the dumbwaiter, Mac.
You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon.
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
Hey, how ya doin', cutie?
You know, I never got your name.
Okay, Mack!  Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an insane asylum or ain't we?
Yeah...
Yeah!
Yes, I see it! I see it!
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
Bet!
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
He is your husband, no?
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay?
There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, "Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
We found each other, didn't we?
Who's dying?
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
It's an amazing place, don't you think?
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
WAIT!!  Where are you?
How could you do this to me?
You're limping.
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
Why not?
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
Uh, I'd rather not say.
I'd really rather not say.
He's out by the pool right now.
What?...
How about music?  You like classical?
You okay?
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
Alright.  The truth is... I thought we had something here.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
Sure.
So, what are we waiting for?
Scientologist.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
But somebody wrote those songs.
I wish you didn't have to go so early.
No.
You don't have any idea?
"Thrills"?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
It's a miracle.
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
No, I haven't.  And you forgot about the fortune teller.
Ah ha!...
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
I'm hungry.
What's that supposed to mean?...
You expecting somebody you know?
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
That was a long time ago.
Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him.
I never even got to be single.
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
And then what, Faith?
It was a ouija board, remember?
No.  No, you go ahead.
Amazing...
He's a jerk.
Kate is that you?
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
What about Larry?
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
Larry, you've got to tell her.
I came after the woman I love.
Yeah--
I'm gonna take her home first.
I'll come over when I'm ready.
It'll do.
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.
After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the— er— as you put it— main order of business?
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
I wish I knew.
Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
But my own kid bro—
I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.
Working hard?
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
What the hell!!!
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night— we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready— remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens— This bum Wilson he gets the title shot— outdoors in the ballpark! – and what do I get— a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.
It was you, Charley... .
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
What's that?
Now what are you doing?
Terry!
And when things get in your way— or people —you just knock them aside— get rid of Them— is that your idea?
Why, Terry, who said it was?
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
And if you don't?
I— I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And— I never knew a girl like you, Edie.
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
What are you going to do?
Don't tell me— don't tell me!
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
I know what you want me to do!
Charley.
My pigeons... .
A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you had—the only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.
Where you goin'?
I don't get it!
I want to see you, Terry.
Give me that gun.
You still call it ratting?
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and—
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
Better.
You ought to go home and take care of that—
Hey, Skins—  --get away with that sheet metal all right?
Count this.
Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking to get his neck wrung!  You should have  You should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs messing in our business.
You want to know something? Take the heater away and you're nothin'— take the good goods away, and the kickback and the shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros—  —away and you're a great big hunk of nothing—  Your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger!
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
I was afraid one bottle might get lonely by itself.  Now you see the advantage of a little man in a big coat.
If I could get my hands on you...
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
In there.
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
Could it be some kind of college initiation?
Can't we get out of here?
You love me then?
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
Yes, yes yes I know all that.
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
You may take her now.
You better hope there is.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
I want to speak with you, please.
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Did you know that when you married him?
I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.
You're good.
Adele?  You in there?
You were his what, his box?
I'm not dressed.
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
Where in the hell are we?
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.
Oh, man.
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you.
Let's go to Detroit.
First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of.
And she saw you?
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
You ever wear one of these?
They found the safe.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
You talked to him?
The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
All right, but...
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
Yeah, why?
Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.
Put it down or I'll shoot.
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?
Who's sitting here?
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?
Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
Why, are you famous?
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
I mean, romantically.
That's my dad.
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
Why not?
You like bourbon?
A girl.
I like your hair.  And that suit.
Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
You really wear that suit.
I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.
What were you gonna do with me?
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
She <i>knew</i> me from some bullshit dope bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike?  "I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled."
What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
Looks like tonight.
Thanks for your help.
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?
What's it mean, "No Hair"?
The <u>ninth</u>?
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
I'll send it to you at Glades.
But you're sure we've met, huh?
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Why's that?
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?
Wait a minute.  I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends.
Right now, son.
I can tell.
I'm looking for Maurice.
No.
Got run over by a car.
Was a she, name Tuffy.
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
He's about to.
"Hey, yourself."
What are you thinking about?
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...
Did you pay the guy the reward?
...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle.
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!
Do you always stutter?
Nervous?
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
I didn't mean it.
How come you're not pukin'?
Get me into a plane!
Land of the free.
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
It's not getting any longer.
Hey!  What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
Yeah.
Don't get smart with me, son.
Sorry to trouble you.
How often you fight like this?
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
It's all right.  Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.
What?...
It must of been a convincing letter.
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
We have achieved complete surprise!  The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.  We can launch a third wave, Admiral.
What if the Japanese did invade?
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
Let's go.
Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
All right. What's the scoop?
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
You really love me, don't you?
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love —— Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
Forget it, it'll never work.
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
I thought you were...for a while.
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand.
Terry! Slow down.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
It was Beth's idea.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
Damn that Charlie I
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
Hi, Dad.
Quiet today?
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
He'll win.
How did it go with the pantyhose?
Does everybody have to hear?
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
I have a note.
Who was that man?
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
What are you doing?
And the butter.
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a four—eyed worm.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
Sort of.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
Silicon is from sand.
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
I hear you moved into town.
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
What's wrong?!
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
I think so.
All set?
So where're we going?
Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot.
Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
You want me to help?
It's getting pretty late. We better go.
How can he not have a heartbeat?
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
You ever think about running away?
Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?
How long have you been here?
How did it go with your father last night?
Are we interrupting, Andy?
What's wrong with your face?
What was the file name?
Why, Beckett?
Thanks, Walter.
Thanks, you guys.
That's the third time. I better call the office.  Would you relax, please?
Why are you getting dressed?
Drew!
You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you?
You don't think there's much time left, do you?
Thanks, Charles.
I know that, Charles.
Innocuous?
New baby?
Kids are great.
Nine.
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
Big trouble.
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
Who'd you get?
Rayisha.
The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS.
One more thing, Your Honor...
What do you want?
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
What?
I've considered that.
I know a good probate lawyer.
I'll look over the Q and A.
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
A regular all-American guy?
Do you have any lesions on <u>any</u> part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?
I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.
Do you take risks?
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
Some do. I didn't.
You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
No. I can't really see it.
Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?
Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American."
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
We're going to draw blood.
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
A homosexual encounter.
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?
You have a problem with gays, Joe.
I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? "Is that mine? I thought it was yours." Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
Don't know, Joe.
Whoa, whoa...  What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
If it please Your Honor, we <u>hope</u> to settle this matter.
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
Let's continue.
Julius!
Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business.
Gonna lose everybody out here....
You came for us....
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
Oh, Lord....
What whispers?
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
Why, what'd you hear?
Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
Just come with me!
How many bottles?
Hey.
A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
He can pilot?
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
Smoke screen for what?
How much?
Well? Is it just the pump?
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --
Hasan?
Imam. Slow down.
The sled as a shield....
SULEIMAN!
New Mecca....
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
Such as.
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
You were tryin' to kill him too.
Take it.
Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
Taylor, I'd rather you -
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
No.
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
Landon! Send a last signal.
Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?
All right --
No cigar.
She comes along too.
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
I told you not to bring the other one.
How so?
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
What about me?
Of course.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
Are you going to take her with you?
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
You want her that much?
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
Do you believe him?
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?
We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here. 
Sarge?
Say I can dig it. Smoke that shit everything kinda gets weird y'know?  Y'hear that story the gooks is putting chemicals in the grass so's we become 'pacifists' so's we don fight  Where the hell's everybody, they'se gettin high that's what - bunch of hopheads, they think they special...
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
But what'd she actually do?
...I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time.
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
'People say I'm the life of the party cause I tell a joke or two although I may be laughing loud and hardy deep inside I'm blue...'
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
You volunteered for this shit man?
What we got here a crusader?
What are you talking about! 
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
Good morning. Can I do something for you?
You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
How did you meet him?
Nice of him.
What time is it?
Cold?
Want to dance?
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
They're going to arrest me.
I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
You'll never make it.  You've out- smarted yourself.
I think you mean that.
Yes, Miss.
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.
I'm about to be very silly.  A man passes a girl on the street--a very lovely girl--his eyes meet her eyes, and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart-- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd--and he says to himself, "There goes my lost love"-- and it's true--if he never sees her again, it's still true.  Of course, after a while, he forgets-- or almost forgets--because after a while we forget almost everything.  But this man is a copper.  He gets orders--routine orders--to go to a place and investigate a murder-- and everything points to a certain girl.
Time's up.  I'm off the case. 
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
You do things the hard way, don't you?
I'm still asking. What do you want?
Private eye?
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
I go home and paint the kitchen.
Got it on you?
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
The usual grind.
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
In case you want to have us followed.
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
What are you doing here?
Passkey?
You nasty, sardonic--
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
Got a moment, Inspector?
We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name.
I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap.
She didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. That stuff was all gone through last night.  Anything special you're looking for, Inspector?
Where's the shell?
Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
Now, you're being beastly.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
You'll have to take my word for it.  We don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
This girl is a murderess, Killaine.
Ye have, have ye?
"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?
You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
Get out of here!
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
I have a rough idea.
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
He's a little unhappy.  I hope he wasn't a nuisance?
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
To Ann.
So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.
Give them here.  This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up.  All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country.
Committed to memory.  Forever.
Attributed?
I'll have some of that.
Oh yes?
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
I called you a taxi.
I think we're ready now, thank you.  And how was Norfolk?  Did you get on with my mother?
I haven't seen much of you.
Might?
Jeremy phoned this morning
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
Not yet you know any of these people?
Bastard.
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
That's enough of that.
Hold those rights.
Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton.  Perhaps you should come too.
Thanks.
Not bad.
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
It was last year.
You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
You gonna pull?
I can't do this.
I'm not armed.
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
The hell are they?!
What do you want?
Meaning you were expendable.
You had enough?
Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  Then a different set of track, over there.
That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
I'll see you there.
Mmmnnn...?
What's he got?
What in God's name...?
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
Your uncle will like this.
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
Mr. Harris.
Stop.  For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
I... I would take advantage of it.
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
You looking' for some company?
That's ridiculous.
Mind if I turn on some heat?
Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
What's your name, lover.
Better believe it.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Room service.  What do you drink?
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
Try a strawberry.
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
No?  Why's that?
The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.
By breaking up a company's assets --
Vivian --
Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.
But you want days too.
Never answer the phone.  Ever.
The Rex.
Hello?
You liked the guy, though.
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you.
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
What did you do to him?
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!
Aw, don't... no...
What's up, where you going?
What time's diner tonight?
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
You're being ridiculous.
Oh, my god... Edward, no!
You broke my nose.
Looks slow tonight.
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
Yeah.
You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
Want a pair of boots?
Couple a hours.
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
I'm just going to my room.
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.
Hi, Barney!
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
Would you like to try it on?
What?
To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
Rest, Highness.
On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
You mock my pain!
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
We'll never survive.
We did it.
Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
You're quick.
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
Faster!
The Man in Black?
-- Fezzik, please --
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
Will this do?
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
What?
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.
Yellin.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
Your guess is as good as mine --
Now?
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
-- all that I have and more please --
Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
Sir. Sir.
Sixty-five.
This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
Humiliations galore!
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
You're amazing!
Kill me quickly.
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
You're just stalling now.
What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
Think it'll work?
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
Good, what is it?
What is that?  A handkerchief?
What was I saying?
Yes, it's quite possible.
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please. You're holding me too tight.  I'm an honest man.  You don't understand.
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
Will you get a hold on yourself.
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
What kind now, Leo?
You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket.
What is she gonna do here?
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
Do you think he'll take the job?
So much for Nutsy Fagin.
To failure!
They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!
Don't help me.
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.
Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're late.
We make love?
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
Heil you know who!
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
People can hear you.
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
Very early. Dawn.
The following morning. Sunday.
What do you mean?
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
Of course not.
No. I told you, she's confined...
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out.
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
Is something wrong?
What thing?
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
You want me to stay here?
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
Let's go see Al Chambers.
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
You can't go up there.
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
The only girlish thing you have lost.
You can't laugh at it, huh?
How can you even think a thing like that!
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
You eat like a bird.
Is your time so empty?
You should... mind it.
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
She sounded strong...
An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse "someplace."  Put her in Someplace!
Thank you, Norman.
You slept here all night?
Mary is Lila's sister?
Norman took a wife?
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
Just coming up to ring for you.
I'll get your bags.
Looking for me?
I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place...
My mother is not dead!
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?
Just before she died she came to--
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
No, I don't want money. I only want to find out who you are and where you live. My business is finding peo- ple. Not taking their money.
No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
What's down there?
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
What is it?
What is it now?
What were you dreaming about?
There's no child here, and no dogs either.
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
There's no hurry. It's early.
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?
Why, certainly, sir. My fiancée. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
But why? She's the best friend I've got.
As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
Which one is me? The horse?
Well, why so mysterious! Come on, spill it.
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Where'd you get the stag hound?
Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
I told you he was a sore.
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
You weren't going with her?
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
To lunch.
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
She is the soul of that statue.
I'd know him anywhere.
To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.
I've been dreaming about you.
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
'Course it does.
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
Rose, you must know who the fellow is.
I got an awful toothache.
I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.
Neither do I.
Yeah, I know.
Open that door, damn you!
Heh, what a hypocrite.
There goes Mother.
Let's go peep from the living room.
I think she's gonna kiss him.
This is my place and you can't have it.
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
The point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. She got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and I think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment.
Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.
It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
How goes it, darlin'?
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother.
They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.
Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
Boys? You say to me boys?
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
This conversation is making me a little sick.
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
It's twenty after one.
Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,
Rose, what are you doing up?
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
I got an awful bad cold.
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
Your baby?
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
Well, you run on now.
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
Never again, never again...
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
I... I can explain...
I was going to tell him.
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
You get nothing and like it.  And if we're not blissfully happy with what you tell us, we arrest you just for the fun of it.
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Who cares?
Come on, don't you screw with her, please!  You... you got to want this: armored car job.  CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...
We'll take the CalTrust heist, but if it's no good, we will hunt you down, and Billy-Boy will pull out your spine and he will beat you to death with it.
It's six o'clock.  Time's runaing out.  Decide.
Kittle...
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.
Look, Kittle... pull over and let me out.  I'll be fine... okay?  How 'bout that... ?  Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I don't want to die!!  Lemme out of this coffin!!
The booze.
They... they shot me.
What day is it?
Gimmie a butt.
Why do I always have to sit in back?
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
That's him alright.
Okay.  But, what changed our mind?
Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either.
Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
It's noon straight up.  Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
He went to pick up lunch.
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?
Yeah... great.
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
Alright?
Get closer!  Don't lose him!
You put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate... make him spin out...
Let's get this thing done.
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
Come again... ?
Get his attention.
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
I don't think so.
You always did have style.
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
I told you to remain on the command ship.
They are clear, my Master.
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
I thought she was with you.
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
Hey, are you awake?
Here we go again.
Proper?!
We're coming!
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
He's my father.
Yes. It's you Leia.
Then you know why I have to face him.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
The Emperor has been expecting you.
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
You promise you won't tell?
I was telling the truth.
He might be.  I don't know.
Janet!
Uh huh.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
Right!
Brad...
Maybe we could try it this way.
Good God.
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
Promise you won't tell Brad.
On the day I went away.
Wheeling
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
I think you had better both come inside.
The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants.
Some people are very shy by nature.
I would say you're very shy by nature.
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
They're all the same.
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
Don't you open them anymore?
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
...Are you going to say anything to him?
Is everything all right?
...I can't beat him.
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
...Like you?
I can't go out.
Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out.
Oh, Rocky!
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
Owe you what?
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
My side.
No doctor!
You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!
How 'bout this Billy Snow?
Kiss my ass.
We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun.
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
This a con?
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
That's ten bucks.
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
Yo' yellow, old man.
What's ya name again?
A hundred an' thirty.
He only had a hundred an' thirty. -- I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles Jergens -- Please, have a seat.
Rocky, would you be interested in --
What?
How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
I don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties --
...What?
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
The legs must be goin'.
...Who'd ya fight?
Rice is a bum.
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.
Really think so?
Please, kid.
What cha say, Benny -- Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman, Benny Stein.
See how fast he is -- damn!
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
Wanna keep goin'?
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
How's Butkus this mornin'?
...What kinda dog is this again?
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
Yo, Paulie.
Yo, Paulie.
Don't get mental, man.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
Ya sister knows I'm comin'?
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.
Ain't sure, what's the story?
Ya really like her?
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
We can cut that out later. Apollo Creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away.
Do you feel you have a chance?
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
What's that comin' from the bar?
I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
You?
You shot Roger.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
Where is he?
Now what?
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
You tricked me, damn you!
Pattycake!  Pattycake!
What the hell are you doin'?
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
Keep reading...
No, kid, you're a real hero.
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
Is the day so young?
Out--
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?
'Tis he.
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
Banishment? Be merciful, say death; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death. Do not say Banishment.
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
What?
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
I take thee at thy word.
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
And so did I.
A most courteous exposition.
Pink for flower.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?
Do you have it?
Well I don't!
Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides, I'm not IRA no more.
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.
What in bloody hell is going on?
I still am.
Now, what did we steal?
Are you alright?
Where's the case?
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.
Bullshit!
Sent it where?
I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
Hello, Jean-Pierre.
He's tough, your American friend.
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
Yeah.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
So what is it you want to know?
Created?
Long enough to shoot back.
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
The question still remains: what do we do now?
What's going on?
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
I borrowed that, too...
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?
It is at that.
I never made that claim.
No you don't, and you know it.
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
And now...
What's the story?
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
Why didn't you kill her?
You slept with her!
You put everything on the line because you...
My man, how you doing?
Doing well.  This is?
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
I've got one condition.
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
I don't know...
Look.  Dwayne was right.  This is going to be a big story.  So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
That's not what I mean.
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
You're out of your mind.
Not bad enough to kill him.
It's gonna be o.k.
You don't know if he was really gonna --
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
Listen Earl.  I covered for you. For both of you.  I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me!
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me.
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
That son of a bitch.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
You're worth every last penny.
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
So do I.
How are we going to do all this?
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
And what's that?
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
Don't you have to be here?
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Yeah.
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Anything I can help you with?
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
Nice of you to join us.  I did say three o'clock, didn't I?
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Whatever...
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!
I'll settle for a third of that.
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
You want to see how more unglued I can get?  Try me.
How's work?
Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.
But nowhere near three million dollars worth.  I would say maybe twenty thousand.
You think he skipped town?
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
Invitation, please.
Wait.
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
Oh, you American?
All I did was invite them for a drink.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
What are you doing?
Well, hurry up.
Goddamn you got a small ass.
You.
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
It sounds impossible --
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
Follow the Rich White Man?
Who?
You sound like that all the time.
Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
Slow down, baby.
Is it hot in here?
No.  It's not right.
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
Well we're not friends.
Yes.  We have heaven.
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.
Ricky Tan is alive.
That your gate down there?
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
What's going on?
Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information, it belongs to us.
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
He stole my wheel!
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
You have one of these?
You speak English!
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
-- what the hell is that?
That silly-ass look on your face.
Right....
You make the plate?
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
What?
Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant.
That's not how it goes.
Which one?
This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.
Like that.
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.
Oh no.
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
I could get promoted right out of here.
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
Jesus...what do you want?
Oh my god...what happened to you?
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
You don't like it?
How much they want?
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
What?!
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
You sonuvabitch.
Where do we find him?
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
What is he up to now?
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
Yes.
Of course.
And in a "V".
I'll get the dress.
Lesson number two.  Never work for your former spouse.
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
Yeah.
Okay, we'll order out.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Sorry, no.  I just got one.
Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
It's nice that they're still friends.
Your two cinnamon rolls.
Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there.  You don't think they'll call it off...?
You're going to be very disappointed.
Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
I don't know.
I'll have the same.
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
Kind of isolated.
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
I already explained about that.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
Yes I do!
About a minute...?
Does it matter?
Ya think?
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
But I'm weird.
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
Lighten up, wahine.
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
What happened at the luau?
I'm really rooting for this one.
A harmless joke.
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
You take the microwave?
I hate boats.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
But it's on the water.
Is that all right with you?
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
It's delicious, trust me.
When you get back, I'll be gone --
About forever.
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
You should write something about this.
What was that about up there?
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
What?
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
Hello.
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
What about the letter?
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
Howard.
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
Are his folks nice?
Sure you do.
Who is this?
What are you going to do, Sam?
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
Hey, my plate is full.
When's the latest time you were out there?
You'll find out.
Write her.
Do you want a fruit plate?
Dad?  About last night?
Not.
Does red pepper go under R or P?
She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!
Will she scratch up your back?
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
Bye bye blackbird.
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
I'm starting to forget her.
This is a good letter, Dad.
Jonah!
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
You said we could go to New York.
No.
What if I couldn't get to you?
Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.
We live two piers over, don't we? Number 12, right? We're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by.
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
You saw her in the airport and then here?
Hi.
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
You haven't tried locking them up!
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
Who? A scab?
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
Why are they singing, Mama?
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
Was it expensive, the beer?
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
What's the matter?
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
You might get hurt.  Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!
I waited up till midnight.
Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
Go on. Spill it.
You know I don't think that.
That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
How?
Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
Go ahead.
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Is that how you play?
Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
I need my paycheck.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
Really, I don't want to.
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
Who is it?
Maybe I am dealing with it.
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.
How the hell did we get this detail?
What time is it?
I'm hurting.
A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ...
You wanna score some go-fast?
You want a hit?
What does J.F.K. stand for?
Danny?
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
You don't trust me?
Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
By not disgracing her memory!
You don't understand.
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
Come on, guys ...
Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this?  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
What the hell is this?
What?
You don't find that repugnant?
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
What the hell are you doing here?
I was trying to score some dope.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
That's real sweet, Garcetti.  Thanks.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
Turns out he's connected.
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
We know what's going on.
He's the only one I told.
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
You're lucky, Flynne.
A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
You think that's a good idea?
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
Yes, sir.
Good luck, John.
I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
No kiddin'?
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg.  The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor.  The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found.  The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
Captain, what about our deal?
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
Uh, Captain...
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
You alright?
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
Except this time, the mission IS a man.
No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
What do you think?
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.
Goddamn it!
Don't do that again.
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Shit, sir.
How can you, how can you say that?
I'll take the whole set.
Lloyd?
Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
Gee, it's easy.
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
No, no, don't go in there.
Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
That's not even a scam.
Then what's love?
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
C'mon, just do it.
Wait for me for when I get round to the front. 
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
What does it say?
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
I wouldn't get my hopes up Lloyd.
Lloyd, it's us.
Wait a minute.
Why?
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
I can put that together.
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out.
I didn't think anyone would get it.
God, that's... this is ridiculous.
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
I won?
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
Oh yeah.  There was, uh, somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio, and, uh, we got this telephone call, this guy is making a sound effects record, and he'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream.
Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.
Thank-you.  The real world.
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Are you busy on Saturday?
Well...
I'll go.
I'll go.
Eight. Eight O' clock.
What are these?
So it's an honor?
So we can finally talk?
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
Sure I do.
So what's your job this summer?
Nice one.
Won't you see me later?
It's okay, everybody does that.
Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?
No.
I don't think so.
I don't think I am.
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
You shared it with a dick.
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
What?
PAIN!
Okay, I'll give here the message.
Hi.  Lloyd Dobler, sir.  Pleasure to meet you.
How ya doing?  Is she around?
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
No, really.
She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.
Oh, I was just going to...
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?
Later for you, Luke.
Oskar - my friend Lena.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
It's not a charade, all this?
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
All right, okay, let's talk.
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
You took my workers.
You asked for shoe polish.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
How you feeling, all right?
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
Oskar, good of you to come.
Thank you.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
It kind of looks that way.
That'd be fine.
The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.
He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
Four hundred, four fifty -
They arrived.
There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  I don't think that's a good idea.
We know that, son.
We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
Shit.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
Outside.
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
I thought you were going to the mixer?
Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm  on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room.
What do you want from me, Cotton?
Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far.
And are the police sure about that?
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
I could use some therapy.
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
About what?
Go on, untie him.
Yeah, we’re trying to send a message to Hollywood. I’m really getting tired of all the happy endings. It’s just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
Two.
Where's Sid?
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
He hates Oliver Stone.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
We had to have financing.
Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.
You have every right to be upset.
Yeah?
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
What do you mean?
It's good to see you involved.
Yes, goddammit!
He tried to kill her first.
I got a surprise for you.
That was good.
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
What was that?
Do you work for her now?
I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
Well what number are you trying to reach?
You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
Nope.
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
Did you request this case?
Oh yeah, how?
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
Where are you Dewey?
They found another note?
What about me?
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
What's your point?
What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
Nobody said she was an actor.
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.
Are you saying she was-
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
I know!
Who's this?
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
You're dead!
Where?
WHERE?
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
What? She asked.
I didn't kill anybody.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
Duh... that's quick.
You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
You rode your bike out there?
It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
I'm so sorry... please understand.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
Hello?
What number are you trying to reach?
Hello.
Hello.
Who is this?
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
That's not what you said.
What do you want?
Dial someone else, okay?
Is this some kind of a joke?
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
So you better leave.
How do you know his name?
Please don't hurt him.
I wanna play a game.
No...
What's his name?
Now for the real question.
...please... no...
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
So is Dewey your real name?
I like it. It's... sexy.
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
Should I be worried?
Drive by patrol.
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
About thirty seconds.
Off the record. No cameras.
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
Stu was with me last night.
Stop. Right there.
Don't come any closer.
What's Leatherface doing here?
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
Do you believe this shit?
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
No way.
TATUM!
That's mature.
That's not necessary.  You're in.
He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
He's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it.
"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
Already.
How you feeling?
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
I guess... decide for yourself.  I don't know what it says.  I'm going to go.
What?  What?
What do you mean?
It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.
You didn't know.
Where we headed?
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows.  Isn't that true?  How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity?
A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
I... I don't follow.
You just met me.
When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
There's a bucket here.
It's a bucket of vomit.
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
Well?
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
He must have left another puzzle piece.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?
And?
How did the fire fight end?
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here.  No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.
Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month.  He says, quote, "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained about him.  He's the best tenant I've ever had.
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
So they ran our list.
What are you going to say?
What are you talking about?
We could use about fifty more men here.
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
Where's the victory?
You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  You think you're toughening me up?  Well, you're not!  You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.
Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
Oh, you want to stay now?
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
You know he's fucking us.
Slut.
This painting...
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
Did their son see it happen?
It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred...
You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
What you saw wasn't Lucy.
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
Got a warrant?
He cometh forth like a...
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
It's what we're here for, ain't it?
You got any more orders, Captain?
If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
If there's anything I can do, sir...
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
I've come now...
Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp...
That's what I said.
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche?
Well, come on!
Say it. We're beat!
And you think we got a chance to find her?
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
Why?
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
What I heard back there was that a band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago...
Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing...
Ethan, quit it!
Well, you're a widower now...
Why didn't he make his move back there?
How? She's even forgot her own language!
Go on! Get out of here while you can...
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
Don't go takin' that stuff...
Might at least have left me my pants!
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
She'd be about thirteen now...
Where?
But couldn't you...?
I'll do it myself.
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
What are you doing?
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Where have you been?
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this.
Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?
I really hate to bother him, but...
And that is?
I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar.  If only I knew...
You did not like the speech?
Oh…what have I done?
Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.
Do you know that house?
I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
Words, words, words…once, I had the gift…I could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstones…for sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnery…but now
Interesting.
How long has it been?
No, your marriage bed.
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
This time we take your boots off!
by order of the Master of the Revels!
How?
Is it going well?
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
No Juliet?!
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Where are you going?
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
Romeo.
Juliet? You mean Ethel.
By God, I wish I knew.
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
Ethel.
The daughter of his enemy.
Two hours at prayer!
Not ready? Where is she?
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
Your mother, and your father
But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek.
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
I do not know how to undress a man.
Even your play.
And that was only my first try.
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
Then I will go with you.
I know how to fight!
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
And break her heart and mine?
She loves me, Thomas!
And her voice? Like lark song?
But what of Lord Wessex?
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
You're a bad loser.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
No.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
That was good.
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
I want to secure it.
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
Is this being recorded?
Are you recording it?
I don't know them.
What? Uh, no, no, it's a fake. I picked it up in Thailand. The second hand doesn't sweep, you see.
And you like it?
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
Did you know --
Well, she had problems --
The man we know and love.
You see, they don't really know me.
What are you doing?
Don't.
No.
I don't thinkI can.
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
Be careful.
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
What's he doing here?
You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice.
Leave him alone.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
Aren't you going to answer it?
You'll wait in the hall?
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
Interesting.
It's about the burglary.
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
That's what it cost, David.
Expecting anyone?
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
Who have you talked to?
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
You get the job done.
Here?.
You must be Hugo.
Would you like to come in?
What do you do?
Writing seems easy.
For what?
Sorry?
Offering it for debate.
You're in a good mood today, George.
I thought you were in a good mood.
That kid... the hairdresser.
Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
What?
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
I don't know.
I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers...
-- to be put in that kind of position...
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
I can see that.
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
Your husband?
Is she all right?
Hi.
You going to answer it?
Want me to?
Well, is she your girlfriend?
Are you?
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
Chopped liver?
Well, are you? Are you queer?
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
I asked you first.
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
... just, you could look very heavy...
Yeah, it is.
No kidding.
You are.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
What sort of references do you have?
You promised you'd do the show.
Jesus...
How long you had this?
Well, what do you think?
You would?
Jill's coming with us.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
It was after you, baby. After you.
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
George... how about Felicia?
You know what I'm talking about.
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
You don't think so? I do.
-- sure.
-- but you never were much of a tit man --
Me?
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
I've got to leave?
Look about last night --
That boy always does great. He's a corporal or a squad leader or something, just wrote me from some place called Kwang Due?
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
-- took a bus.
Jackie Shawn.
Call me!
There were some shots.
Here in the canyon.
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
I just... who what?
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.
Now, George --
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
You're different.
Honey?
Yeah.
Go where?
They didn't offer you the job yet.
Jill says nothing.
Never mind. Where've you been?
What business meeting?
I know, honey.
I don't want to fight, George.
How come you took your own car?
Didn't you, baby?
-- and take this with you.
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
George...
George, now cut this out.
No.
You need a cut.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
It's an unusual trade.
But the important thing is you're successful at it.
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people.
When?
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
You look like you've had quite a work-out.
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
You live like a pig.
All night.
I wanna hear about it, George.
Did they have something against me?
Have a drink.
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
What about Jackie?
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
Sid.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
Here.
No.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Poster-Kleiser.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
Well, what is it, honey?
Five times a day?
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
What?
It's been so long I don't how long?
C'mon.
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
Well he's not exactly a friend.
This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
You're kidding.
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
You seem disappointed.
No of course not.
Call me Les.
Dad?
Are you sure?
Who's Tony?
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
Mommy!
Shall we go into the living room?
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
Tony.
How did he manage to do that?
How?
She eh... interferes.
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes?  We're on our way through to the basement - I promise we won't keep her very long.
Glad to meet you, Winifred.
Beg pardon?
I did?
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd.  Thanks.
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
Get him out of here?
You mean just leave the hotel?
I just want to go back to my room.
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!  Please...
Stay away from me.
Stay... stay away!
Stay away from me.
Mr. Ullman?
I'm Jack Torrance.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
Right there.
I'd better collect my family first.
Hi.
What time does the plane leave?
Lowe's car-?
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
What's the money for?
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
There's something else scary.
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
Mom-!
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
Don't call me dear boy.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.
Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
But how?
He's... dreamy.  He's...
What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!
What? 
No... it's fine.
Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.
Oh, girls.
Where did that come from?
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
That machine.
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
What is it, Mary?
Jackpot!  Two buckets
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
What?
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
What?
I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
It'll be hell.
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
Mary Clarence!
WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART
Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you?
Mary Clarence!
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.
I see.
Miss Van Cartier.
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
The vow of obedience.
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
What's wrong with my life?
Yeah?
I got it.
It never solves anything.
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
You sent for me?
What?
But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
And if I don't?
Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
No nothing.
Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
I am?
I have?
Vince knows you're here.
I can't go with you.
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
Then one day they find you.
Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
But you didn't tell me!
Well?
I can't see anything in here!
You didn't shoot!
Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?
It should be here any minute.
We've got to save her!
Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
She's... she's a nun.
If we could speak alone.
What the hell are you doing?
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have time alone.  You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.
The Widow Windsor.
Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia.
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
Thank you.
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
I hear nothing.
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
What good is this?
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
What books?
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
He has proposed to me twice.
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?
Thank you.  No.  Here...
People have put their trust in you.
Must I hear this?
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
What is so urgent?
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
If you think I am behind this, say it.
Katrina...
Where are we going?
Quickly, close it.
Use caution.
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
Where?
I know you saw me.
There was not much blood, was there?
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered.
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
She is guilty.
Thank ye.
They say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things.
We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street I believe.
He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.
I'll see you, Bill.
Yeah.
About a half a mile I think it is.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
You know what we ought to do tonight?
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
Well, honey, I don't guess I give a shit. I ain't here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin' in the garage, I don't guess I care. I've got a good tool box and socket set out there I don't want stol'd. I guess I could take it home with me.
I ain't sure.
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.
You believe in the Bible?
I ain't never used no hatchet that I remember.
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
What are all them books?
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
Don't you live somewhere?
They let you out?
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
They still around, your folks?
How did your mama die?
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
Maybe they needed it.
I like the way you talk.
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
It was still alive when you buried it?
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.
Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone.
It was fun, anyhow.
Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here?
Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
You all right, Mama?
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
You walk fast, don't you?
I'm ye boy.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.
Okay.
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
No! At least I don't think I am!
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
Jesus, what happened to you?
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.
And what about for you?
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
How'd you get started?
A photographer ...
But they're all the same.
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
Hey, man, good to see you.
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
Seventeen.
It's for you.
Open it.
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
I just want to know where he is.
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
No thank you.
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
Hi there, little brother.
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
What are you talking about?
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
Yeah, that's right.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
Where did you get that thing?
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead.
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Ah, coffee. Smells good.
Thanks. 
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
Lettuce and tomato?
I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.
$1200 an acre, that's what I paid Ole, won't take a dime less.  You got no choice on that.
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
Boat has two batteries.  Lose one you run off the other til morning. Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave him one a his.
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?
We discussed that.  And decided not to.
Doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful?  Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.
I can just feel my spirits soar.
My father can't get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol...
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?
...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.
You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
Greedy.
Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion.  I didn't have a lawyer...
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
Well, the sheriff found <u>two</u> batteries in your well.  If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
Well, why does it?
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
We don't let go, you s...
What for, Sheriff?
You must think I like losing.
Does it now?
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
No spare.
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
What else could it be?
So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?
In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
Improved...how?
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Are these your bags?
Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -
I beg your pardon.
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
You're welcome.
No --- how does it go?
Okay. 
What happened?
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
You've flipped your wig!
We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...
You don't see any blood?
And it's so drafty.  They must be catching colds all the time.
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
My name is Josephine.
This way, Daphne.
Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...
What are you doing?
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
Blow where?
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
Me?  After Sugar?
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
What is it, young lady?  What are you staring at?
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
What happened?
What are you giving me with the omelette?
I tell you, Joe, they're on to us.  They're going to line us up against the wall and -  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us - I tell you, Joe, I'm just going to die of shame.
Not that, you idiot.
Hello, my dearest darling.  So good to hear your voice again.
I don't know about the captain - but the navigator is getting his tail out of here.
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
That's us.  I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.
She sings, too.
Oh - Sugar!
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
Anything wrong?
How's the bottle?
Who needs vermouth?
Not you, Sugar.
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
His yacht?
Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
Yeah - Josephine.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
What for?
I always did.
Thirty-four.
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
Please.  It won't happen again.
But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
You're leading again.
Why not?
I don't like no witnesses.
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.
Well, here we are.
Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
Me?
Really?
Brains aren't everything.
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.
Are you staying at the hotel?
I'm not interested at all.
How's the stock market?
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
Shell Oil?
Well, I guess I'd better go -
I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.
Love it.  Which way?
What is it?
It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
You mean - like frigid?
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
I don't want to bore you.
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
Is that anything?
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
Anything this time?
You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax. 
Well - ?
I think you're on the right track.
Tomorrow night?
A merger?  How long will you be gone?
Daphne -
Haven't you got another pew - not so close to the band?  How about that one?
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
Refresh my memory.
Thanks, Charlie.
Hi, Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I should get going.
Fred Astaire and what’s her face!
Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.
It was such a long time ago.
If Ed ever found out....
You’d better get going. My parents will be ‘round to cart you off to the country.
Say something. Please.
Where’s Nick sleeping?
I’d be happy to. You’re welcome.
I thought you said you were crap.
You heading to the train station?
What’s his problem?
Nothing.
Hey.
Nothing, nothing.
It’s called character. God, you’re predictable.
So, what’s your point?
What color are my shoes?
Not the way you’re thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.
Your “friend” guaranteed my anonymity.
The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.
You shit!
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
Are you asking me if I’m gay for pay?
Don’t stop asking questions, okay?
It’s hard to explain.
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. It’s all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, you’re not walking away!
You have had girlfriends?
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
And that’s when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
You’re right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
You didn’t have to do that.
What’s he do anyway?
Like fifteen.
I’m worried. Amy’s not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it ‘drunker’ or ‘drunker-er’?
I always wondered what happened with us.
What is it you do again?
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
They lived a long time ago -- before you and I were born.
Here it is, right here.
What about Sounder?
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
You think about your father a lot, don't you?
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
You know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence?
Can you swim?
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
But, Charlie --
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!
You learnin' anything at that school?
We didn't find Sounder yet.
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
From Miss Johnson --
You know somethin', Daddy?
What's your daddy's name?
When's that?
Miss Boatwright --
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
Any sign of Sounder?
Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!
Good night, Mama...
What's that you carryin'?
So when I left, she gave me these books.
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
Well, let me have it.
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
Hi ya, Rebecca...
What did he want?
There, you see?
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
What...
NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!
OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-
Fuckin' a right.
What is this?
<b>And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!</b>
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?
Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.
Suck my balls.
I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
I can't believe he's dead.
But they fucking didn't do anything wrong!
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
You're late, Cartman!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
The N word?
Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting political, I'll throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab. Mkay?
What?
You bastards.
Look at that!
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
Donkey raping shit eater.
Yes I am!
MMMMMPHPHPHPHP!!!!!
I am Satan. I am your God, now.
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you!
Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!
Who is it?
Guess.
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>
Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!
It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
The F word?!
Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
But I-
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
Who's my cream puff?
You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
What did you do today Satan?
<b>What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you-</b>
Hey, I'm missing the party!
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Did you see that, Wendy?
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
What the hell are you talking about, kid?
Hi Wendy.
NAZIS!!
You don't have watches?
Got it.
Getting drunk is no solution.
Well I appreciate that.
So...
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?
It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
You're certain of that?
Why, didn't they say?
You gotta think of your old age.
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.
That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.
I don't know what you're talking about!
So, what are we waiting for?
Look at this...Jesus.
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.
Taylor?
Do you want some advice?
I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.
I'm not going with you.
So close...
Will you marry me?
Where's Taylor?
I'm going back for Taylor!
What the hell is that?
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Is it safe for human transport?
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
You know, Elvis bowled.
Sure, Sid.
How do you turn this thing off?
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling.
This scam we got going here was your 
Buzz Fazeli.
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
Theo.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
What about bowling?
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!
NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.
JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
What if he wants to get out?
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
I bet you didn't know that you and Junior have something in common, Theo: Junior can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively, his face a blank.
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!
Do you know where they're taking him?
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
Kinda tough on the butt.
What does he do?
Whoa.
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
What are you going to do about your brother?
Nothing.
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
You told Junior that we did it.
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
He's dead Sheila.
Where are you going?
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.
Theo, Buzz is dead.
You're really pissing me off.
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.
... Your civil rights have been overridden!
Wait a minute --
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
They told me about sixty hours.
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
Don't do it, Norman!
Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.
How deep is he?
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
They pressurize us with helium.
Don't get hysterical, Norman.
Harry's missing.
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
I don't want you talking to Jerry.
Yes, sir.  I'm here.
Can you open that panel?
Subs are still at surface, sir.
Yes, sir.
It's chipped.
I did.
So?  What's the problem?
Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
Some sort of lead or something.
What's wrong?
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
They switched us over.
Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
Norman!
Yeah, it was awful.
What do you mean -- not normal?
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
In Edmunds' things.
Don't do this.
Maybe you should go.  To the sub.
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
None of this was here before.
Ulcers.
Riordan?
Parasolutrine?
P-a-r-a-s-o...
Doesn't say.
It's an idea.
You ever given an injection before.
I'm sorry.
What is it, Norman?
What's wrong, Norman?
Are you manifesting them?
Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
That's when you went in the sphere.
You're insane.
I promise --
Don't, Beth.  Please.
Stop it!
You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't fight me.
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
Top shelf, is it?
Norman?  Where's Norman?
For who?  The fish?
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
Why are you looking at me like that?
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
Where's it coming from?
How are you feeling, Norman?
C'mon.
C'mon, Norman.
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
Not a clue.
You remember opening the door?
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
Beth left?
It's the squid!  Stop it!
Her legs are in the way.
You know how to work this thing?
There is one possibility.
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
English?
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
Looks like a design, some writing, maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
What'd you say?
Good idea, Ted.
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?
What report?
What report?
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
You want me to try?
You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
Well, we'll see...
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?
You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
They use the Bogan Force.
When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?
What do I do?
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
You're Starkiller?
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
Is he afraid of the water?
It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!
You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
Are you safe?
You rich kids... are all the same !
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
No, this hurts.
Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...
Saddle up, Roughnecks !
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
Did you read her mind ?
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ?
It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
Carmen...?
Where are you going ?
Zander, what are you doing ?
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
Zander is going for pilot, too.
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
Do you mean it ?
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.
Which way ?
Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
What ?
Well, see ya.
Way to go, amigo !
You used to dance...
What frequency ?
Good good, then it's all settled.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
Best in the Fleet !
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
Alright, we're gonna carry you...
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
Sergeant, secure the boat !
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?
They have repressed the Creator.
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
'To learn all that is learnable.'
Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
... but I still recommend further simulation study.
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
Captain, what's the next move?
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
Was he difficult?
Mr. Spock?
Hold station.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
Hold station...!
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
They had a pattern to follow...
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
What should you have known?
Has not, Doctor -- and now, because of what we are planning... will not...
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
Then you'll be wet.
He have any special dietary requirements...?
I have one, but they lost it.
I quit the movie.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
You like my play.
Why?
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
...such a pleasant sound.
In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure if I'm giving <u>them</u> a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  That's the truth.  The truth's best, don't you think?
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
Me?
...lost the screw...
Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
Later on.
But it's absurd.
What've you got?
...he stuck a fishhook in it. 
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.
Press still works.
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
Lookit that, up already.
Annie:  you stick to the Amateur Theatricals.  This isn't quite the same thing, you see?  This is Big Business, in which, our Life...  ...s'no less a <u>commodity</u> than...than our...
Drama Group?
Ten thousand dollars.
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
Well, where do they hold court?
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
It's Marty on the Coast -
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.
The prices are going up.
What do you drink?
How old are you?
Her...
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
Tell it with...
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
No, you're absolutely r...
Are you Okay?
No, I...just...just Joe, just Joe...
We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
You guys had better leave us a...
I'm very sorry to...
Aren't you ever in school?
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
No.
Get him on the phone.
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
What?
...wants a piece...
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
Kiss my ass.
...he's the producer of the movie.
He didn't have to tell...
I...
I'm looking for the writer.
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
What?
He saw the accident...?
I'm very sorry I...
I'm trying, honey...I'm...look, is your Ma, when is your <u>Mom</u> coming?  Oh.  What did the <u>midwife</u>...?
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some <u>nosh</u>...what do you like to drink...?
Why?
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
Hi!
<u>Siddown</u>!
She doesn't show her tits!!!  She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
What is that...?
It's lovely.
I don't got the money.
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
I've got two days to get this house...
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
...the damn thing...
He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
She coulda done better than him.
You think so?
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
Where are we?
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
Ben!  What's wrong?
So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
I'd rather be with Mommy.
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
I'm gonna call him.
Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the shower.  What did you think that was about?
Well, not exactly s...
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
That happens.  To families.
We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...
He's not even there.  You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
You lost Ben?!
I'm sorry, okay?  Let's not fi...
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --
The timing was off -- I need this light.
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
You think this is funny?
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
No they're not.
You know, this horse smells really bad.
Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're late.  You're really late.  Now get out here and have some cereal.
No!  Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops on the bottom.
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!
In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
Where Ben?
Okay.  These are good.
Find the bird cage?
If a soldier loses his legs in a war.  Is he the same guy?  Sure he is.
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
You say that like I don't know that.
And when did that pass?
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
That's necessary, huh?
I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...
Because you don't really seem here.
Something's up wi...
Our children.
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
I grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
It's a huge moment in their life --
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
Yet another spaghetti night.
What happens next?
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
Get out!
Yeh?
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
I'm sorry, I just...
Jackie?
Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...
Look, you've never liked me...
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
So I have to tell you something in confidence...
Moi?
The primo stuff is great for pain.
Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.
Thanks for coming out.
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all of a sudden...  Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...
We have the kids this weekend, so...
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
You don't trust me to be alone with them.
But?  But what?
She's not gonna die.
Restless.
Where you goin'?
There are some rumors...
Marty, ignore him.
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Consuelo?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
Who is Jesus?
Maybe it's for the best…I mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrong…People who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
But really, you never know.
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
So whaddya think?
This is definitely better.
We're not ready!
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
You're tired of me. I can tell.
But what kind of pull did you have?
What DO you know?
So? How was school today?
Get the hell outta here!
Dad?…Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Who is this?
Scooby?
You want some?
What for?
Is this to like get into Sundance?
So like, yeah…I caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like …still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviews…Y'know, I figure I can always drop out.
Can I see what you have so far?
Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry...
We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
I'll lead.
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
What about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!
Are the labs in operation?
I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
And what exactly do they intend to do?
How goes the roll call?
Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?
My crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team!
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!
I have your word, Mister President?
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
Get a grip on yourself, Major!
Now, snap out of it, fella!
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
General Schmuck?
Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
Yes, sir.
Why do you think I ask?
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
That is correct, Major.
You know the regulations well, Major.
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
I suppose they are, sir.
That about right?
General Ripper, can I ask another question?
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
Yes, sir.  But so do we.
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
It was a honest mistake, sir.
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
We don't operate like you KGB boys.
How long will it take to receive them all?
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Look, he's there, and you're here.
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
Give me a first rough course as soon as you can, Lieutenant Ballmuff.
I've got the heading, Major.  One-three-eight.
What else could it be?
War.
Check.
Check.
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
They must have made a visual contact.
They can't touch us at this height.
Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says.
Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?
Where'd they get you?
No kidding.
Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
In about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar.  Cross in over the coast low-level, continue low- level on zig-zag legs to primary, and climb for bomb run.  Any questions?
Primary circuit is live.
Release first safety.
Second safety.
Master safety.
Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?
Yes, Major.
Where'd they get you?
He's dead, all right.
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
Wait a minute, Major.  "OPE," that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
That's the point.
I'm okay.  What's up?
Are you sure?
Maybe the warning system's out.
At the bottom of mines?
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
We are?
Mn-hm.
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
How long were you in there?
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
Typical male.
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Your a nurse?
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Yeah.
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
No, no.
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
A long, long, long...
So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
Go!
I know, man.
What?
Ah, you know people there?
Yeah.
Hey, come on, man! Limo!
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Am I fucking him?
Buff.
Hey! Hey.
Score! Yeah!
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.
Yeah!
Thanks, man!
Yes.
He is.
Yeah. So, what about you?
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
That's what I mean.
Hi.
It's coming along.
Erica, you coming?
Can you tell me what happened?
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave?
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
Yes.
Why? Because I give a shit?
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
No.
No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick.
Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.
No.
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
About things that are important to me.
Oh, yeah?
Okay, what would you have done.
What?
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
I've run out of words.
Do your covers and all that shit.
Hey, Pony.
No, it's not...
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
Yeah.
You know, I've thought about that, actually.
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Look, get down off my property.
Get off my property!
No, this has everything to do with you.
Is that your driver?
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
So? What's L.A. like?
Like?
You do not!
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
Yeah, come on, play it.
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
Soon.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Is that Jeff?
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Oh, How'd she get back?
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Leave him alone, Tim.
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
Could you give me a ride?
Fuck.
Hey!  Rule number one - never take off the mask!  Y'hear me!  No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
I sure do.
Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying.
Hat-trick?
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
Yeah, hold on.
Ammo?
I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie... I'll just say I'm counting dirty words for Sunday School.
Hello?
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.  Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.
Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!
You sure you wanna go there?
Bank branch!
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
It must be about that appalling script of hers.  What can I say to her? What can I say?
Good party.
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
I had a teacher like that once.
Check.
So do I.
I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
I'll say.  This is solid gold.
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up!  Why are you staring at me like that?
From Artie.  What's wrong?
Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted.
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos? That's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes.  Careful of these tiles, they're slippery. Valentino used to dance here.
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
Her own movie theatre.
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
What assistant?
Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.
What's the matter, Norma?
I wouldn't know.
How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
Or shall I call my servant?
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
We've made a lot of pictures together.
What month?
I want you to do this work.
It's getting kind of late --
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
There sure is.
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
Keep it.
What's the matter with you?
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?
Don't you want to come along, darling?
He must be quite a guy.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
That's a lie!  They still want me!
Wanted what?
You heard him.  I'm a star!
Suppose you listen just for a minute -
This room has not been used for a long time.
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
Is that so!
Some men are here.  They asked for you.
Uh-huh?
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
Got a title?
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
It must be the girls. One of the girls.
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
I don't feel like it right now.
At last. Ultimate Power.
Is this Nigel's doing?
Maybe it was just an accident.
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
This is my favourite place in the city.
Like it?
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
Let me kiss you.
Is this how?
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
Away. From you.
Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?
She's right. They'll string her up.
Hey! Ethan!
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
What is it?
Nurse! Nurse!
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
Yes.
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
Superman will return it.
Why is he acting so strangely?
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
Nigel, get lost.
That was meant for me!
I was on Earth...
Others?
Are you happy, Zaltar?
Zaltar, please help me.
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
Then teach me how.
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
Yeah? What do you want?
Not enough vodka in it.
Brad?
All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"
Peanut butter and jelly.
I can never get a way from it.
He really was!
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!
It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
A television set?
Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
Uh...what channel were you watching?
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
A computer.
Everything.
Anything.
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
No, we're just going down.
Whatcha wanna stop here for?  Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.
Who's the other woman?
All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.
Why do I have to do this?
Ricky?  Where...what...
Thank ...you.
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
I can't! It's out of control!
That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
It could make weather!
Computers talk to other computers, right?
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
Small potatoes.
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
Yes! This time we got it right!
Anybody been hurt?
Are you okay?
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
I'm listening.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
Gee. But --
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
This way Lex.
Artemis? Do you read me?
Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman - that overgrown boyscout...
You must be freezing.
So --  I hope you like it.
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
General --- ?
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
Gee, I don't think . . .
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
But Superman isn't an average man.
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
What's he going to say?
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
We'll all fry.
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?
I'll deal with you later.
But . . . how could you beat him?
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
You're a great architect, Albert.
Me?
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
Do you know where you're headed?
Are there any more at home like you?
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
Stop him, Clark!
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
It wasn't a trick!
Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
Is that what they're calling him?
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
Your father was a sick weirdo.
What's the temperature now?
Krypton!
Ahh. 'National Geographic." In my day, this made 'Playboy" look like Mother Goose.
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
Don't let me down.
You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
I don't understand.
Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
You can't do this to me!
I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
Two.
The good lord works in mysterious ways.
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
Who...who...
Wha'...what are you doing here?
Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
I gave him this new face.
Please...
I still don't get it.
This is California. The richest, most populous state in America. And growing like a sonofagun.
Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
We're...not together.
Then...when did she get better?
What...does it turn to?
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
Say hi to Zoe.
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
Well, it being so depressing and all.  But it's reality.  You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea.
If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing.
No, Billy.  We can't drop the lawsuit.  You know how much we need the money.
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
What time's he coming home?
Yes.
You're leaving.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
I have to.
Because I have to.
About the Ottos?
From what?
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
What do you mean?
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
He knows that?  Billy?
You've talked to Billy?
That's what he said, is it?
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.
Away from your crazy Mom.
What happened to summer?
How was it?
So do you like your new room?
It's like a song.
Nicole?
I have no questions.
What do you mean?
How old is she?
I'm in a car wash.
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
Why can't you talk to me?
Yes.
Tell me your news, Zoe.
Some more wine?
Yes.
Are you expensive?
Are you a reporter?
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.
Yes.
You are?
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
You could see the speedometer?
You saw the speedometer?
There wasn't time?
That was great.
Of course.
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
The door needs a lock.
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.
Yes.
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
He's somewhere...
Come on boys, break it up...
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
I could think of better places to meet her, instead of here.  He lives on the whole top floor.
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.
Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
When do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee?  He's trying to take you off the hook.
Frankly, J.J., I don't think you got the cards to blitz me.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
Uh huh.
J.J., I want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet.
Well, what have I got?  Alimony to a pair of tramps?  They're of no concern to me.  It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again!
I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?
And who's feet is she on now?
What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!
Talk to her, Sidney...
That's a question I usually like to ask YOU.  Your secretary phoned.
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
Is Frank D'Angelo around?
Don't you know who that man is?
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
That's the third time he's called today.
But...
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
Go home, Sally.  It's late...
If that's for me, tear it up!
I'm feeling too good to fight with you, but that isn't what I said - I said you snoop.  For instance, what were you doing around my hotel the other night?
It's a habit with me.  So now I'm briefed.  So what?
Why me...?
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
Susie, whatever problems you have with J.J. - I didn't invent them! What're you blaming me for?  If you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!
You haven't told him yet...
I get the feeling, Falco, that you're always snooping around...
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?
Do you know about the chip?
Yeah?  Who sent you?
I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
You have to do what I say?!
Swear.
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.
You will.
Alriight!!  My man!
I'll deal with the police.
We don't have much time.
Will it melt in there?
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
So she's pretty cool, huh?
No shit?
It, John.  Not him.  It.
Mom?  You okay?
I got it.  Piece of cake.
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!
Can it be destroyed?
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
The CPU from the first terminator.
... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
I guess so, sir.
What the hell are they doing?
What's that mean?
You have a question for Helmuth, David?
Yes, David?
Can I ask you a favour, Major?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwängler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
You live here, in Berlin?
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
Mine's the Eleventh.
I'm sorry.
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
Did you call someone you knew?
Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
How?
If it's too hot, open your tie.
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
I have no idea.
I'm sorry.
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
Okay, so what is it?
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
Major.
Yes, you remember.
Show me.
I've remembered something else...
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwängler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwängler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
Oh! The evening before, I see...
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Can you handle it?
Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
What do you think?
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
You must have a girlfriend.
Do you understand?
Just let me go.
Reese...you got a first name?
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight.
You'll learn.
About what?
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
I don't think I like this.
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Here, drink some of this...
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--
You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.
Admittedly...
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.
You don't talk to me like that.
I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
See you around.
Please...
You deserted me.
There goes a thousand dollars.
Never did catch your name.
That's classic.
Where are we going?
What exactly do you do?
A fresh shirt...
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
You can talk while I drive us to the police.
It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.
What did you say?
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
What do you think you're doing?
What the fuck are you... ?
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
Listen very carefully, I'm telling the truth... this is the game.  This was all the game.
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
Julliard, yeah.
Yes.
Happy Birthday, man.
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
Really?
What's this all about, Connie?
How do you mean, exactly?
How do you know?
The phone's dead.
Split it?
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
I need your car, Elizabeth.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
May I make two suggestions... ?
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
Goddamnit, why do they do that?
You don't need me...
Where'd you pick up your checks?
I need the police.
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
Mr. Van Orton... ?
What makes you ask?
Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
Goodnight.  See you home.
The Hinchberger wedding.
I don't like her.
What?
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
He hasn't called back.
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
I didn't do it.
Nell!
I, I just can't...
Eleanor, how was the drive?
You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.
Sorry.
All right...
What happened after you smelled it?
Hmm.
Are you coming to confess?
It was a stupid thing to do.
Welcome Home.
Someone is playing with you.
But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!
No.
What happened?
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
I love this house.  I really love this house.
David.
Is it over?
Why?
Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you.
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
Nell, what happened?
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
It's not a compliment.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
Italian?
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
We think someone is here.
When you find the guy, you'll know.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
What kind?
You should have let me do the talking.
You think I'm staying?
You broke last time.
You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
You're in gun country now, my friend.
What more is there.
You're kiddin' me, right?
No.  Not at all.  Do we?
Five years, I think.  Long time.
What's so fucking funny?
Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
What d'you say, Elaine?
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
Why did you come here?
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
Here, are you always this sarky?
Oh, it just ended, then.
Ashamed.
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
When did you get in?
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
I see.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
Oh, I was gonna say ...
Not that I recall.
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
How far?
Fancy it?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
It was you.  Downtown.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
Don't you work with Ian?
You sure?
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
He's expecting you?
You know her?
I miss my kids.
Is he here?
In a couple of days this whole thing --
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
...I'm so sorry about your loss.
...Yes?
...You don't like the music out there?
Hello, Rachel.
Yeah.
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
...I stank, didn't I?
But more or less.
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
You got the dough?!
...Was that a pass?
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
...Ed, I...
Uh-huh.
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
...Oh, Jesus.
Please, Ed.
...What kind of man *are* you?
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
Yeah.
Yeah. What do I, uh...
Coffee, Ed?
...Ed?
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
Birdy... I didn't mean to--
Mr...?
...You're Ed Crane?
Hello!
He's a barber.
Second chair.
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
I'll go down and speak to him.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
Dr. Green has to see you!
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.
What are we talking about here?
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
What's going on?
Dr. Frock?
Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
Quiet!
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
Shut them up!
Jesus, what is this?
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
Mbwun.
What do you make of it, Margo?
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
Where would we find it?
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark.
What was it?
We have to try and draw it off!
Help someone!
Close up?
He was curious from birth - premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
You take Japanese.
Lauren, right?
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
What's that?
It'd be an adventure.
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.  I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me--
--we need more charcoal.
Let's go now.
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.
--What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i>  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?
It doesn't sound insane, Truman.  I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces.  I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.
You got it.
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
I think you better tell us.
Poopy day?
What do you do?
I need your clothes, Byers.
What is it you find incredible?
You've got something to show me.
Of what?
Yes.
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
Have you examined them?
How'd you find me?
You a reporter?
Who sent you?
I think you're full of shit.
Negotiating with whom?
How can I reach you?
You found something?
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
Had you.
Scully?
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
What? What are you talking about?
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
It's like jelly.
What did you find?
You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
What are my choices?
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
Where'd they go?
What? What's wrong?
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
What? What happened?
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
Scully --
We've got to keep moving.
We're going to the morgue.
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
A virus?
Why are you telling me this?
What happened to Kurtzweil?
He hates me.
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
Nothing.
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with.
Well look at that.
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
She changed the codes.
Instead of going into his mind...
Catherine!
So?
We proceed assuming she is.
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
Right here.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
Why?
Do I...
Wer ist da?
Have you seen Calloway?
...you know.
...and my lover. He was Harry.
...is there?
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
That's his headache.
Oh, well.
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
...Austrian Police Headquarters.
Can you tell me whose...
...to him.
Listen, Callaghan.
Get the next plane.
A parrot bit me.
Fifty yards right down there.
A girl of spirit.
Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?
Shall I go over there, sir?
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
Hello - Mr. Martins, we tried to get you at your hotel. We have arranged that lecture for tomorrow.
Zane Grey.
Very popular, sir.
...leaving tomorrow, sir.
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
Unwise, Holly...
You told them, didn't you?
You really liked it?
...your address?
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Already gone.
Baron Kurtz.
You remember me? Upstairs...
Could he have been conscious?
...give evidence.
The Roumanian?
Yes, it is.
Harry...
That's all you meant?
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
What else did he tell you?
Third Man.
Should I make it all fact?
...Mr. Martins?
If you could see your way to lending me some cash -
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
Richard - I saw a fin!
A shark fin?
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
He tried to borrow money from us.
But he has been there, off course.
Hi.
I think so too.
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
What's a fascist?
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
What, do you like it here?
You coming?
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
Who's Linda?
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
Where are they?
The sex is better.
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
What's it about?
And belief follows?
Why should I submit?
No, I think you shouldn't.
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
I thought there were people here....
Who's Eichmann?
An investment banking house.
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
Those aren't Jews.
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
But if the Jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already?
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.
Who killed Manzetti?
I always won.
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
How did you get the fucking number?
Don't tell me what I --
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
What is happening?
What about chicken?
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
Tell it to Hitler.
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
Hello...?
Isn't it true?
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
Get out of here....
Open it up.
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.
That's all we've got left.
Didn't you get anything?
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
Are you an artist?
Who'd you kill?
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
It's Friday....
Adam Sandler.
We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.
We tested the new bomb.
May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....
Oh, fuck you...
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
And you...?  Do you love Enzo?
Johana, am I boring you?
What's happened??
Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.
You're right.  You're fired.
I tell you she's mine!
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
Is it a poem?
What else is there?
Because you'd laugh.
Why?
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
Yes?
What about the shoes?
Plenty of women everywhere right?
Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden.
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
Your mother?
... Everything.
Two years younger than you.
No, I have to ask you a favor...  You're the only one who'll understand.
What?
Here...  Here...
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!
... How long was I asleep?
No!  I would never cheat you.
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
But what brought you to Sicily?
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?
Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
I'd better get back now.
Jacques, you set a world record.
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
How are you?
So have I.  ... Hello?
Then, tell me a story.
Hello?
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
Where are you from, Henrietta?
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
It's his heartbeat.
... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales...  or are you still over your limit?
Does that have a hidden meaning?
What is it honey... the frenchy?
... And those?
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
Your mother? Oh. Whoops.
That got annoying fairly quickly.
What!?
I want you to talk dirty to me.
I want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.
Your mother was right. You do work too hard.
What are you doing here?
Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.
Happy Hanukkah Tikva.
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
Cool. What's it do?
Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system.
What are you doing?
Hammer, you alright?
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
What should I charge?
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and —-
Mmm———yes.
Then what do you do?
What's left of him.
It's a blackcard and bad card, but not the card of the cat -— not the card of four—footed things.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
The death card - -
See you tomorrow —-
He will be waiting...
Pedro is waiting for me, too.
Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't ——
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
It was you, Galbraith!
Tormented -- ? Why?
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
What are you getting at?
Yes. The lipstick.
Chief, don't you understand what this means?
On his back, I suppose.
Clo-Clo?
Suppose I slip them a few bucks — for the funeral expenses.
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to soft—soap twenty editors!
I got into a little crap game.
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways —
We stood here once before.
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
That’s right.
You wouldn’t recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
I won’t comment on the time but you’ll understand if I don’t tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard. 
I found this at your brother’s.
I can’t tell you that yet. But he’s being well looked after.
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you can’t satisfy him?
Whatever the reason, I’m sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
Huh! Don’t you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
Adonis thought your brother’s body’d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn’t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
You’re wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down...  Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought he’d wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found...  Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I don’t know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest...  I didn’t know any of this before you left for Los Angeles.
One just doesn’t... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But it’s never that complicated really.
You know something? I’ve just seen so much ugliness I don’t think I’d mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  I’d hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if that’s the way you want it.
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brother’s not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
What do you suggest?
There’s nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money, right?
Okay. The woman just can’t walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why can’t you go to your Embassy?
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why can’t you go back there?
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
There’ve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, it’s just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?
A recent acquisition. We’ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flat’s been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
A little too tight, eh?  ...They were my son’s. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  I... There’s some cold chicken salad in the fridge if you’re hungry.
No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
Then find another way.
They’d never let me go. And you’d end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
Hi...
We’ve still got the Italian...
Shit! Fuck! What’s fucking wrong with people!  I’m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
Where is the Austrian?
You’re not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
Who are you?
And who does Friedman work for?
How many of you scumbags are here?
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
Hello again, neighbour. I didn’t intrude, did I?
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe it’s there with...
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say you’re my secretary, all right?
I’d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. I’ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I’m in a hurry. 
Hello, Jane. It’s me.
Carlos De Moraes?
May I...?
Must I speak to you in French?
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
I didn’t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
This car needs petrol.
Maybe I don’t.
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. You’ve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name he’s using?
What are you talking about?
Will you be alone?  The merchandise. Is it just you or...
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
I’m sorry...
It’s wet. Will this do?
That’s what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldn’t take on another child, that he’d get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasn’t listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think he’s back on drugs, eh?  Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know?  Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some people’s minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leon’s. He did beat the drug, though. He did.
What’s the date?
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
Now, can you stand up?  Can you use your legs and stand up?
Barstow’s 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever you’re heading, I reckon somebody’ll pick you up.
Qu’est-ce que tu veux?
Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...
Le montage, l’emballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors’ stuff. How much would it cost me?
We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest.
Why did you kill him?
I think you’d rather not know what I think.
What sums?
Moreau? C’est moi. Alors...
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
I also need someone who can read and write.
I thought you were an archer?
Who do they think I am?!
Jeanne, stop it!
Good.
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.
The king said you're his finest archer...?
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
I don't know it.  I feel it.
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
What did the king say?
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
No, but...
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
To be killed in battle?
We must sound the retreat!
Do as I say!
I am ready now...
We have to press home the attack!
Go onto the next question.
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
And?
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
Yes, but...
I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
I understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
Quick -- hide in here...
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
You must take the oath!  Not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.
Were you baptized?
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?
Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
Does he have hair?
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?
5,000 gold crowns.
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
Wait, wait...
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
Well...?  Shall we go?
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
Prepare these as battering-rams!
I don't know... I thought...
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
Why were you yelling like that?!
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
God asked you to do something?
No.  That was a sword in a field.
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
Are you going to leave me too?
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
My father's.
Then... why are you here so often?
Him?
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
A beauty. Who is she?
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
Who are you?
Dorota!
I'm on the run!
Have you seen this?
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
Boys, boys...
Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
What's the matter? Are you sick?
What are you reading?
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
Dirty pig!
I don't know how to thank you.
Watch your feet!
Careful! Watch his hand.
Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done.  You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea! 
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
She looks tired.
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?
What for?
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
T-w~e-l-v~e.
Yes, why not.
I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
No, words. You have never heard words?
Hello, then.
And when is the next lesson?
Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta know it's all there!
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
You got a bag or somethin?
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
Twist, you know this guy?
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.  I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up.  There ain't a better insideman alive.  He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
There's always a depression on.
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
They're still looking for him.
I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
Lonnegan after you, too?
This isn't like playin' winos on the street.  You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
How'd ya do?
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
I better do some packin'.  I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.
We'll use the wire.  Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.
He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie.  How much cash we got?
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
My end was only one.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
It isn't any better.
What time you get off work here?
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?
He'll have to take a check.  I couldn't find my wallet.
What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw?
I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.
And you were gonna pay me back?
I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much.
What happened?
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.
We'll take it.  You manage the building at the end of the alley?
Do ya know him or don't ya?
Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
What's your next step, Nick?
Why not?
Cheer up, darling.
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.
Any luck?
I can't.
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
What is it?
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
Mother!
Is your father still in there?
He didn't do it -- Nick!
How did you ever remember me?
I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
She fell down.
It's been the same one for three months.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
I know -- I know --
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
Not at all.
Shrapnel!
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
This gun yours?
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
You mean that body-----?
He telephoned me today.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
Do you think that Wynant did it?
Have a shot?
That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
Where were you?
I know.
Why, you said...
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
Oh, he's sitting up.
Oh, please, Nick.
Thanks, and goodbye.
How are you?
I see.  I see.
It might.
I've done that already. He should appear, you know.  It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
But he has nothing to do with it!
Why tell me?
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
How many drinks have you had?
Who's that?
Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
I never saw that before.
Finished with these?
But Wynant --- ?
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Mimi!
I wish you'd tell me who.
Come on out, now.  He won't hurt you.  Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
You worked here?
I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?
Bonds, sir?
Who fired you?
Where were you going?
A casual one.
They stopped.
What are you doing.
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
There's nothing we can do.
Should be easy going from here.  Stay on the pass straight to the dot.
You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
Wes--
They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
Just keep quiet.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
What!?  What!?
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
Now this is war.
Invest it.
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
It'd make their heads explode.
What do we do with the Humvee?
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
It's a mine, isn't it?
There's a way.
How's this going to work?
You're going to be fine.
You're going to blow yourselves up.
You're not losing trust, are you?
Iraqis.  A bunch of them.
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.
Where is it?  Where'd it go?
They're going to kill us!
It looks like you're not doing anything.
Wait.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.
First Wes, now you?
And you; you've got it all together.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
Well?
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
Oh, God...
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
What do we do?
Is that good, or bad?
...Wes...?
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
Well?
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
Epps?
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
Well, this is it.  We get the car, find some Americans.  We find Americans we'll be all right.
Woods.
Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
Spanish wasn't hard enough?
And you're the guy who's going to open it.
Jaeger?
You ever think about dying?
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
Iraqis.
Yeah!  Yeah!
Epps...
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
What do you think?
It's got a bottom.
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?
I can't hear him.
What did you get?
When?
Then why did you bring it up?
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
What time is it?
I'll try.
I can't go on like this.  I can't....  I don't just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake, it's all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?
What are you doing?
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
THX!
I thought you were through with it!
Who?  Who's leaving?
I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled... 
I won't have another mate like ONA.  You rate very high in sanitation.  I've checked.  In fact, I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH.  Her ratings are very erratic - you know what I mean.  We'll be happy.
What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!
I'm leaving.
How do you know?
Maternity ward, huhh!
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
I don't know.
I knew him.
That's not it.
You don't know that!
Remember this...?
Yes
....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me, I slipped on....
And you are...?
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
Where did you get this?
High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
Only once, at Redstone.
This is where the van was parked.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
How long are we going to stay?
Right.
Why do you do it?
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
Ex-girlfriend?
Driving in circles, waiting for-
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.
Whadaya mean?
No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
Then why tell me?
Why are we stopping here?
Who are you calling, sis?
Alex, please-
Drop it.
You touch me again and--
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
Prints?
What about the ballistics report?
It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap.
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
Next week we work the park.
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
You don't fish.
What was it this time?
P.E.T.N ...
Device.
So what're we looking for?
What?
I'll do it.
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
Yes.
I wanted to say goodbye to you.
No.
But--
Good morning, Major.
Nice day, Major.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
He's really not a bad fellow.
And, waiter--you see that moon?
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--
But not now.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
Who?
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.
Please.
I like you, Baron.
Darling!  Now tell me--tell me all about yourself. Who are you?
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
--the other half, contrary to custom, shall be delivered in cash into Madame's personal custody.  Darling, that means that on the second of June we'll have eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
Five, seven, and nine--
Éysée seven, eight, nine, two.  We have to clear out.  Railroad station? Ticket office, please.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Now, Lily--
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
Then you go into the foyer.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 
Naturally I did.
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
What shade of powder do you use?
Yes.
Oh? 
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
No--yours, madame.
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 
I'm crazy about you!
Yes, Gaston?
You look beautiful.
Mariette!
Adolph J. Giron.
Goodbye...
It could have been marvelous ...
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm having a tea party. Must I be bothered with all these papers now?
Yes, madame?
About what?
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
Yes, madame?
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
Shit.
She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...
So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?  That's great!
None of the stewards have seen her.
We're too late.
What could possible be funny?
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
But I was with him the whole time.
Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
Why have we stopped?
Hello again.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
Are you nervous?
You have to go for help.
You jump, I jump, right?
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
Yes sir.
Is your stateroom alright?
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.
Anya!
It would be a nice change from you.
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
Isn't she lovely?
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
Will you pardon me?
You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
No-o!
Where'd you get it?
Tell me.
Thanks.
Mighty decent of you, pal.
That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
What?--
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
You don't think--?
Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
Shortie!--you know my motto?
Inspector McKinney.
Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
I'm going to the show--
This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
What?
Come on, get up.  That horse is carrying too much of a load.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
I didn't--
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
Well, let's hear the poem--
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
Get that out of your trunk.
Is that one of the Who's Who?
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--"Gee you're tight."-- and the window says--"You loosen up a bit and so will I."--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?
What for?
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
That's him! That's the sucker!!
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
How much did you lose?
I went for four.
I wish I could.
--you'd go with him!
Not because of Ned.
Congratulations.
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
That's the truth--every single word!
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
I'm all right.
Everything in order, sir?  What are <U>you</U> doing here, my lad?
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'.
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?
What d'you think of the singer?
I saw that look on your face just now. What's between you and Wyatt?
Where'd you get that horse?
I want them spitting blood!
Hey, you smell that?  Smells like Something died.
Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get Some, boy!
Forget it.
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
All right, lunger.  Let's do it.
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man?  Forsaking all Others?
Doc...
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
Don't touch me!
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
All right, I'm on fire!  Black Seven, seven stickin' spades. Let's go!
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.
That was lovely!
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
No, no, get away, get away from me...
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.
Wyatt, I couldn't find a single Store that had laudanum any-
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
So what about you Cowboys anyway?
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
Well what do you think happens When you die?
Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry If I made a worse mess for you.
I just got it fixed.
That a fact?
Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?
Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
Her maiden name was Sullivan.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble.  And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head.
Virgil?
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
Why don't you just leave it alone?
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.
My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
I'd rather die alone.
In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
Yes -
Wait a minute -
...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
Paris?!? What are you doing here?
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
No.
Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.
Bourbon. Neat.
Nice to run into you again.
Down?
What now? And don't give me some movie cliché like 'trust me.'
Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it.
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
My name is Sidney Winch, and -
I was an attorney!
You won't get away with this!
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
Damn. It's doing it again.
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
What about ID's?
Oh, no.
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Who is that?!? What's in the box??
I pay my own way.
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
Why don't you come in for a while?
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
I have more sense than to give up everything, my family, you and Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
It was nip and tuck.
I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.
Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die?
Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
What, are you having another party?
What did you put on it?
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.
Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.
Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.
Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.
Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.
How is everybody?
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
Some people grow up and change their ways.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
Wow!  Cool!
Can I bring some toys?
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
Hey!  Wow!
Which one can I open first?
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
Yes, I can.
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
I could have stopped him.
Right?  Buddy?
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
Oh, I'm a sham!!
Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
Hi!
Hey, watch it!
Are you peeking?
No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
A lunchbox?!
You are a liar!
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
What the heck is up there?
It's Sid!
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
W-w-w-we?
I'm red this time.
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --
Woody?!
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
She's not accustomed to being ignored.
Stop it!
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
I'm Melanie.
You're well built; how old are you?
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.
Why does he need money?
Helena, I'm so sorry --
This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
How long have you known?
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
About the other night, I'm sorry.
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
None of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual Drug Czar.
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
I don't know.
Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?
In school?
You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --
Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.
That's a big word for a fisherman.
They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
What do we do?
So, it's worth the wait, right? What can I do?  Rent a Huey?  Have an airlift?  It's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule's asshole, right?  How many peasants would that take?  A line stretching from here to Mexico City --
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
A place we have, that we know is protected.
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.
You watch and learn.  I earn his trust.  Then more pain.  Then I appear with kindness.  Within a week he will follow me around like a dog.
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
She's not at that place you sent her?
Oh, man --
What?
Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help.
Hello.
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?
Who do we interface with on their side?
Well, I've not brought them.
Well, why didn't you bring them?
OK. Same again?
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
Twenty thousand.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
We'll be half-way down the road with the money.
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
Yes.
Well, it isn't.
You're too young.
Happy birthday.
Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.
Do you recall the school motto?
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
You take the test?
Thanks, Mark.
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?
You Only Live Twice?
Who wrote it?
The park?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
Yeah.
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
You know.
Why?
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
A walk.
Well, what are you waiting for?
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
But the shuttle-
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
No, but you can bet they will.
Where did you get this power?
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
Oh, God
Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.
Captain?
Goodnight, Spock.
Not General Korrd.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
I do not often think of the past.
He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
Spock.
Be one with the horse.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!
There's got to be a way out of this place.
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
Is it possible?
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
It would appear we are too heavy.
Spock... don't.
What is this?
Spock?
I trust your message was received?
Sha Ka Ree. "The Scource." "Heaven." "Eden." call it "Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor." The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality.
Your vision?
About the ship...

And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
My dinner.
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
How's it going upstairs?
Did you say Group 7 access?
Of what?
Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.
What do you mean, "'yes"?
No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up?
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
Cute.
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
Dumont!
Well, isn't it -- ?
Flynn!!
Then...
Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
Did we make it?
Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
Flynn, we've got to help him!
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...
What's goin' on?
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
But-what if I can't...?
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
You seem fine now.
How was school today?
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
What's this for?
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.
Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --
Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.
Just hang a minute.
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
She could be telling the truth.
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
He's got it.
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
So, it was your first time.
Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  And I have to get home to my family.
Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
Hello, Harry.
I'm late.
I need you to talk to Dana.  The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.
Now slide the nylons off one by one.
He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
What were you doing there?
Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--
I don't take those assignments.
What are you going to do?
Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet.  But it's not enough.  If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle.
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
Sorry.  Trade secret.
What does she do?
Yeeaoowww!!
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
What?
Who's your little friend?
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
Tell me what happened?
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
Were they trying to kill you?					*
What's happened?
It's a good thing you pay me well.
What do you want me to do?
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.
I didn't get any chicken.
Tell him we gotta go.
Sonny kicks ass.
'Bout twelve.
Tell me about yourself.
I don't remember.
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
Four hundred bucks.
What's that?
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
You know when you sat behind me?
What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?
That dazzling imagination.
No no no no no no no no no...
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
Is this a joke?
I think what you did was...
I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
Damn skippy. He like it, too.
I'm hip.
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
Wannabee nigger...
I'm a married man.
What?
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
How much of that letter was on the up and up?
This shit can't be real.
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
Is he big league?
Elliot what?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
Do you really mean it?
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
What do you think, eightball?
What?
He wants to talk ya.
Elliot.
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
I've seen him.
Oh, don't bother. I got one.  So you're a Sicilian, huh?
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.
Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about?
Or a bit player -
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
What was I sayin'?
You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?
Just put it in your purse.
Put it in your pants.
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
Yes.
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
Wake up, Cole.
No, sir!
Him?  You saw that man?
Women will want to get to know you...
You said we weren't "real," Cole...
We're very close!  Because of you!
It's important to observe everything.
What's wonderful about the air, James?
Do you know what year it is?
It's just a shot to calm you.
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
You didn't have a gun before, did you?
The guy was a total fruitcake.
We need gas.
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
See -- you can drive after all!
What made you think that?
It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
I don't understand what we're doing.
Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.
You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
"What about the germs?"  I say.  He goes, "I don't believe in germs.  Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!" Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you believe in germs, don't you?
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
Plan?  What are you talking about?
Jo...Jose????
Uh, that message...me?
But you know what's real now?
What...virus?
You have him in restraints.
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
That a fact?
The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right.
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
Any parting words of wisdom?
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.
Where in Mexico would you like--
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
Please, you don't understand.  I have to get out of here.  They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me.  If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here.  I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave.
Hey.
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
Then you're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole.  Now why don't you just take your Visa Express Silver Card, call Karl Malden and have him send you the money lickity split.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Please, just leave the car alone.
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
What you want?
Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
What would a truck stop be without beer?
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
What was that all about?
Poor thing.  Is she all right?
Let me get your change.
. . .at the very least.  I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars.  Now, how much did you get?
What the hell you looking at, girl?
What's the matter?
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
Jesus.
I got it.
Wasn't nothing.
Least you can leave.
What happens if you lose?
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
Beautiful?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
You love him?
Did you ever?
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Have you ever been there before?
Take me with you.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.
You got a suitcase?
Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.
He was going to take the money.
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
Are you all right?
It's . . . it's locked.
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
Who the hell are you?
You've got to be--
Live there?
Hey!
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.
I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?
Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
That's a bit much.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
No.
Drop it, Jake.
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
Don't Jake me, boy!  It's a big house.  Odd that you would know your way, except maybe you've been in the bedroom before.  Maybe with Grace to keep you company.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
What happened to your hand?
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
Christ, I don't believe this.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
That's a shame, John.  A real shame.
You're the gambler.  You tell me.
Kids.
Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.
I didn't do anything.
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Now, what's this?
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
A lot that means.
You've got to be--
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Wait a second--
Hey!
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
How much could you get?
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.
Next time you'll do just fine.
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?
Got any requests?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
Will he be back soon?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--
Nothing.
Hundred-fifty.
Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
No! Okay! Okay!
Look, Harlin.
I don't know your real name.
Jesus.
Accident.
It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
Wasn't nothing.
Where you headed?
What happens when you lose?
What do you do anyway?
My face tell you all that?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
Did you ever?
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
I wanted to talk.
What about us?
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
Why's that?
Where ya goin'?
"Arkady"
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
What'd you say to me!
Out of here.
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Anybody hurt?
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians?
Is that the entire message?
Wrap it up.
Once again please?
What about Jeb?
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
Not a specific day. What's this about?
Megan?
You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step.  What is over?
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
I thought he was carrying something.
You have good instincts when it comes to things like that?
Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
When?
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
What do you do if something happens?
You like sports?
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?
In the passenger car?
There have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years. I've followed each one of them... A Seven-three-seven crashes on take off. One hundred and seventy-two die. No survivors... A hotel fire downtown. Two hundred and eleven die. No survivors... And am Amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city. One hundred and thirty one die. One survivor. He is unharmed.  I've spoken with your husband about his survival. I suggested a rather unbelievable explanation. Since then, I've come to believe, that my explanation, however unbelievable, is in fact, true.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...
I thought... you was an angel.
I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
Oh. How long I been here?
You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife...
Charley, see what kind of "books" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet.
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
Hit your finger, huh?
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?
Duke.
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
But... if he doesn't miss?
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
Yeah, I guess so.
Jesus!
I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.
Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...
What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know?
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
Say, Bill...
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
We ain't bad men no more, Bill. Hell, we're farmers.
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
Worms was comin' out.
Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
Hullo, paw.
That fella come by... Tom.
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
Did you... did you... ?
No... I meant...
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
Say, Ned... ?
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
I don't kill nobody without him. 
That ain't what I mean.
What was the money for?
A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     +
&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;It was smaller than that. Sharper.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
What the hell do you want?
Get out.
You have to come.
Fenster and Hockney?
We'll make it.
How are you, Keaton?
What about Redfoot?
The answer is no.
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
A little of both.
Get a grip. I didn't know.
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
I don't know about that.
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
No...
Edie...
If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.
I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor.
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
Well, many reasons, actually...
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
How is that?
...of Anesthesiology?
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
I did.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  This is a...why?  Why would you do that?
It's all right, Mickey.
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
I am seventy-four years old.
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
I didn't do too well for you.
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic.  Ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.'  Does that sound familiar?
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ...
Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ...
Do you know who her doctors were?
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
I can subpoena you, you know.  I can get you up there on the stand.
I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Nothing further, your Honor...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
Pardon?
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
I've got to work...
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
I...please.  My wife...my wife's prescription has run out.  If I can call him...
Uh ...
... now who is that ...?
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
I have to talk to you.
Are you out of your mind...?
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
...he's a good man...
...I have to stand up for her...
They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
Been a long time, huh...?
What happened, Joey...?
Okay.  What do you do when you don't have a witness?
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
...four years ago...
It's not a good case.  It's a very good case.  A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anaesthetic ...
... I understand ...
I just saw her.
Hi.
Kathy Price...
One hour.
Dr. Towler...
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
Would you like a drink now?
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
How can I see her, to know her?
Ernie's.
Yes.
Why did she never tell her daughter?
Hello?
Judy Barton.
Then will you for me?
Mmm.
Will you, Judy?
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
But I like that one, Scottie.
Scottie, what are you doing?
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
I don't like it!
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
You don't even want to touch me.
Where shall we go for dinner?
Ernie's?
Scottie!
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
Scottie, please...!
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
Love me... keep me safe...
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
Please drink your coffee.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
Wandering about.
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
How old?
Why?
And no birds sing.
No, I can't tell you!
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...
No, don't go away!
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
Here with you.
My love... because I love you.
Why?
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
How do you know? Personal experience?
I had to quit, Midge.
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Johnny!
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
What was this desperate urge to see me?
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
She'll be out in a moment.
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.
The floor was wet. She slipped!
Why?
I have plenty of friends.
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
What do you think you are doing?
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
Stop it!
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
Wait. Wait a minute.
So that's what we're doing.
Fuck you Boyd!
What is your problem?
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
We'll be ready Adam.
If anything ever happens to me...
No way.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
Money?
So. When is the wedding.
What are you talking about?
Nothing happened in Vegas.
Yup.
No I don't.
But not tonight.
What's your fucking point?
You said that Boyd.
We need padded chairs.
She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.
Oh God. This is insane.
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
He's cracked up.
Boyd...What have we done?
What?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
The hell I did!
Nope.
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
Stop.
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
May we have the rings please?
These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
Photographer?
Florist?
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
Do you love me?
I need your help.
I need your help.
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
Well you should.
Yeah. Nesting.
What okay?
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
No way.
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
Who's dead?
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
I don't care for him.
I'll take a ride.
I'm getting married...
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
No...No.
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
Greenpeace.
You alright?
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
Well that ought to be about the end of that.
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.
We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.
We will.
She's dead.
Fucking desert.
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother.
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
You have no feelings toward ...
Come down here, you scamp.
His mother wanted to keep him. She came from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That's why I didn't say anything.
If you like, I will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave.
Let me pass!
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
Leave me now. You can go to bed.
Sit down, woman, sit down.  You like me, don't you?
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
Have you thought of what you want planted yet?
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.
He was very good. Better than some people would think.
I don't know, sir.
And this chest?
Miss Viridiana ...
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
Well... is it so urgent?
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
Yes. Why?
How are you today?
Don't say that.
There's been an accident.
Yes -- very, very big!
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
Is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something.
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
Don't talk like that!
She looks like a sick marrow!
How do you feel?
Have I slept long?
What?
How did you see me?
It was very well—hidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
Think you can do it?
Barnes, where the hell have you been?!
This better not be a wild goose chase.
What did Cox pull him out early for?
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
You embarrassed me in front of the highest—ranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
I haven't been working on anything.
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
I wonder how that...
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
How can I ever thank—you for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it —— I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.
You all right?
You ready for this?
What happened when he was 17?
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the son—of-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
Give me your wrist.
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
What does that mean?
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
Relax. I know what you meant.
What the hell's going on?!
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
Real effective security...
Which way?
How did you find out about the toxin?
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
See something?
Can I ask you something?
My guess is dead.
Where's John?
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
There you go —— best seat in the house.
Thank-you, Daryl.  You had me going for quite a while there, sport.
...tonight...
What if he's busy tonight?
What are you saying...
No, this is great.
Y'see, <u>this</u> is what Producing is:  you put me in a <u>Room</u>...
NY Times, Washington Post, War, War, War.  Times got the girlscout page twelve, Post in Section Two.... Horses in Mid-Stream...?
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
What can it hurt.
He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?
<u>IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS</u>.
We're going to have to explain away the...
Why?
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
And carrying.  The National Flower of Albania, something..... Now Is it some Festival?  Some <u>Harvest</u> Festival, something...
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
...uh huh...
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
You're tired, Ronnie.
None of these are ours.  <u>None</u> of em are ours....  ....that's <u>real politik</u>, Buddy.
War's over, Pal. 
He thinks it's too...
Pride of a job-well-done...
Wilfred.
Give'em another pill...
... and he spent the last twelve years in a Milit&ry Prison... 
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
The threat of Nuc1ear Terrorism has been quelled.  We are in <u>contaot</u> with the Albanian Premier, who assures me, and this government <u>credits</u> his assurances, that his country does not wish us ill, and <u>has</u> not.  That the threat which we perceived was not of his wish, or of his making.
THE PRESIDENT, HOLDING THE PHOTOGRAPH
YOUNG PERSON'S APARTMENT, NIGHT.
THE CROWDS AT ANDREW'S AIRKORCE BASE, THE "OLD SHOE" BANNERS, THE "COURAGE, MOM," BANNERS.  THE STILL BAND.  A SHOT OF THE BANDMASTER, SURREPTITIOUSLY, GLANCING AT HIS WATCH.
We're locked into Albania.
Hello...?
Schumann. We're gonna go pick him up tonight.
We're due at Andrews. 
My name is Ronald Brean.
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
What's on your mind?
It can be documented that he displayed the...
But there isn't a B-2 bomber.
Who?
N'it's a crying shame.  But you <u>staged</u> the Oscars...
Three-o-three...
The War ain't over. 
Yeah...?
He can't respond to the Allegations.  I don't care <u>how</u> many girlscouts are picketing the ... look, look, look, we're coming home with <u>Gold</u>.  Eh? Tell him to hold firm for <u>two hours</u>... coming home with Gold.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Not bad for government work.  Having a good time.
Mmm.
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...
...the Albanian Campaign.  And we won't even be a footnote...
I thought they weren't meeting him at the airport...
Just....do what I ...look:  get me a ...hello...? Hel...?  I'm going to need an <u>ambulance</u>, we take him, the last moment, right from the Pl...no, <u>we</u> land, we puttem <u>in</u> the ambulance.  Air force jet lands, we take somebody <u>else</u> off <u>that</u> jet...what the fuck do <u>I</u> care? Somebody in a Hospital gown.  And we need a ......hello?  Hello...?
...what happened...?
What the hell do <u>we</u> care?
Y'know what else bothers me?  "Shh lil baby, don' saya word, papa's gon buy you a mocking bird..."  The baby don'say a word, WHAT THE FUCK IS THE MOTHERFUCKING MOCKING BIRD GONE SAY?  You follow me...?
We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's against us.  We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you <u>going</u>...?
Show Must Go On.
What're you doing?
Don't tune it too good.
We got the guy, we got the guy, we got the Guy!
...what do you got?
I have the White House on the Line.
I didn't ask for a dog.
You like it?
They guard our, <u>you</u> know ... "borders," night and day...
...by you?
The Special Anti-Terrorist Detachment of the Border Patrol... what do they <u>do</u>...?
Oh huh...
Someone's bringing in a kitten...?
What the fuck did you <u>mean</u>, "What kind of stuff?"?
...gimme some help...
...where's my l'il <u>pill</u>?
Yup.
Gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks...
... That's what you told us to say.
He's lying.
If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.
Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr. Lynch.
So whaddaya say pal, wanna play some doubles at Piping? Meet the membership? I got a little blonde named Mandy, about nineteen, avec cafe au lait boobs... she's mine but she's got a cousin who has great muffins.
Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
The stock's going to Pluto!
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...
What brings you out here...
Don't start, alright.
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it.
...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
Sure, and I'm never gonna die either, is this one of your chain letter schemes or do I gotta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in Northern Arkansas?
...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...
I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...
What if he asks where I got the money?
What if they call him?
So, where are we going?
Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?
So what firm you with, pal?
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.
...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake...
Nice club, Mr. Gekko...
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.
Now, wait a minute, Dad...
What the hell do you want?
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
What if I have a previous engagement?
I don't.
Do you think you're ready?
I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
Hi.
Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.  Anacott Steel.
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.
We know what you're up to, Gekko, and let me tell you this from here,  you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar.
He still likes you
Yeah 
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
And uh, your nicotine sir
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
Jenkins.  Can I get you some help?
No Jonathan.
She went to a waxwork party
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
Well?
Well, it all started when a friend and I
This time I really don't see anyone man.
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
You bet.  We all can't be such modern people 
Of course you will.
I started seeing things.
These are good.
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
What's happening to me?
Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
How're you holding up?
Toward the end.  You remember?
Hello?
Tell me.  I can help you.
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
Your house is so beautiful.
Mrs. Frank?
You look a little old for a student.
I didn't sleep with him.
He was so pissed.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
She got it.  Turned it down.
Absolutely.
Sit down here.
What?
Then what was it?
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
Jody, she tried to kill him.
I can't believe this is happening.
I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
I guess not.
Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?
Claire, I have to show up for the--
If you have to work...
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
Of what?
Did she say that?
Remember how we were?
Claire...
Norman, you have to look at this!
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
What are you doing here?
Yep.
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
Get down!  He'll see.
Our house.
It's a flare.
Where is she then?
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
When you do this, I swear...
You're not at the center.
There we go.
Are you lonely?
What?
You dropped a glass.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
Ow!
I don't like this, this...
Leave her out of this!
Adamant.
Do you know it?
What's that for?
I'm cooking you dinner.
Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith.
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
What have the witches always asked of you...?
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
I beg your par---
Who is this...?
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
If that were true, I would not be here.
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
Harder...
Yessss...
Harder...
My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
It's unbelievable that you can do that.
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.
She - she said I - I was a ---
What about your work back home...?
You sure...?
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
No - I didn't kill him.   Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...?
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
When aid you get home last night...?
'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
I heard something like that
I thought you were someone else
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
Oh, about six years since I graduated
I don't know
I don't know
What did you do with her?
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
Yes...
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
Well, what do you think?
What's wrong with you?
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
Just put it in my room
Her husband left her
I thought it was you - how are you?
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
Check this out.  Hurry!
Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?
You'll never believe who's in there.
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
Ted, have you lost your mind?
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.
God, you are so hot.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
You're way ahead of me again?
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?
I-I don't have the keys.
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.
Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
James, what are you doing here?
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
If you could just sign right there.
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
He was my Grandfather, too.
So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
I don't get the distinction.
I guess.
Funny you should say "peachy."
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
Why can't you be nice to me?
Wow...you clean up nice.
I see.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
I see.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
I want you to trust me.
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
I never figured you for a pimp.
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
I'm warning you.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
Yes?
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
Talk to me Artie.
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
About Suzie?
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
I've got that two o'clock in town.
You saw the news today?
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
Where's the body?
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
At that point were you able to fight him off?
He did say something.
I want a full-scale investigation.
Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.
Thank you, Jimmy.
It's those rocks, up there.
I say something funny?
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
Is there some reason why you're here?
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
He... Sam Lombardo?
Don't forget the car wash.
Look, he forgot.  I knew it.
So, where you off to now?
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.
We have to stick with the plan.
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
Hello?
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
Forget it.
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
Nellie Gail Ranch...
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
Where is she?
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
Yes.
But she ran away.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
Jesus, man... You okay?
That was about as grim as it gets.
Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?
Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
Aha!
That's a lot of butler.
All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
Jim, are you all right?
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
Well... that, too.
They're so precious when they're asleep.
It was in your book.
My God!  He's so excessive!
You didn't tell us you had this on!
Anyone?
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
She's perfectly safe.
Look, I'm Captain James West...
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
Dr. Pemberton?
I beg your pardon?
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
Because it's true.
Don't make me angry, Peck.
You all right?
You gotta promise to feed her.
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
Time to change her diaper.
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
I'll help you...!
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
Can't we keep it, Dada?
Dada, what's a daikini?
Who are you!  Who are you!
What's the magician's weapon?
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
Oooh, this smells terrible.
I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.
I'm not going in there.
Are you sure?
We gotta follow them.
Get back here, Rool!
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
Hey, careful there!
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
Where's Timmy and Buck?
Hey, Sam...
Are they going to kill you?
Amish.
So one of them got to him.
You know who?
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
You have no right to keep us here.
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
Where are you taking us now?
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.
But why?
Where's the nearest telephone?
The... bullets?
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
When will you be going?
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.
It's me.
You know where he is.
Did you find him?
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him –
Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
Is the English dead?
That has no place in this house.
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
...have you come back?
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
Uhhhh -- yes...
Oh --
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
...didn't you?
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
Oh, please give me back my dog!
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Run, Toto, run!
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
Are you ready now?
Yes --
...room --
Oh --
Oh - I'll get it!
A home --
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
I'll be home in time for supper!
How about a hippopotamus?
Oh -- Oh, come on.
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
Oh, now I'll never get home!
...yes.
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
Did I scare you?
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
He said his mouth.
The other side....
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
Oh -- Oh --
Oh, come on now - everybody -- 
No -- No -- No -- No!
You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
Real courage. That's what we want.
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.
What happened?
Yes, you.
Sneaking up on me, eh?  Why! 
It's a whatzis.
No?  Now, wait a minute.
...junk!
No, sir!
Animals that -- that eat straw?
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Hey, Dorothy!
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
What happened to Len Tashka?
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
The King pipeline.
Then maybe I’d be... open to that.
Old friend?
Elektra?  Running King Industries?  I’ve known that girl all her life. I’m not sure she knows what she’s walking into.
Who told you to look at Elektra’s files?
You haven’t been given an assignment in this case.
It’s a message.  He wants us to know he’s back.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
Your last chance. Take the money.
The name?
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
Who is it?
I haven’t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
Does this look familiar to you?
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think I’m a coward.
I don’t want to be safe!
I don’t know what you’re talking about!
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didn’t have to sleep with you to find that out.
Where’s M?
So you killed your father.
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
Really Bond, couldn’t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff.
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
Mother of God.
Everything’s under control up here.  Are you ready?
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
Had a lot of blood in him.
Walter --
Hi, Jon.
The bearer of bad news.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
I'm here, Laurie.
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
What -- am I --
She's with me.
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
. . . What?
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
-- What is it.
They're practically on us . . .
What was he doing?
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
. . . That was quick.
Where's Laurie?
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
I can fix it.
No comment.
Their real names, please.
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
Why is that?
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Up yours.
I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
Like what?
Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
Do you know what a wire transfer is?
It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
I don't know what you're talking about.
What are you?
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
Where are we going?
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
Yorgi and Kirill.
Toadies right behind.
You okay?
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
I think I'll hang on to these.
From the Beastie Boys collection?
I can see that. Why?
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
What...?
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
That's the guy.
Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
What's this?
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
What does that mean?
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
How long have you been in Alaska?
Let go.
I do love a good check mate.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
Don't you knock?
Is it enough?
I'll find him.
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
Is that so?
This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
Frederick Frankenstein?
Yes, sir.
Carlson!
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
What?
Surprised?
Miss me?
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
That's a tough choice.
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
I didn't do that.
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
No, it's pronounced Aye gor.
Are these your bags?
There.
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
What are you doing here?
Did you hear that strange music?
Did you hear that strange music??
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
Do you have the name I wrote down?
I want that brain.
Hmm!
Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
Throw the second switch!
More, do you hear me?
Throw the third switch!
Cold!  Cold and dead!
I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
Original.
Yes.
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
What monster?
There's only one way.
Come on, big fellow!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?
Hello there.
It's alive.  It's -- moving! It's -- breathing!  It's -- standing!  What is your name?
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
Ooh!
Look, Doctor!
Oh, doctor!
Reputation.  Reputation!
Oh, Doctor!
All right -- give it to him!
Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes...yes, you have yours.
Yes, I know.
I'm getting tired.
Look how far we've come.
How do you know they're done?
How long is it so far?
Three minutes to go!
Will you hear "Last Post", Sir?
From the Cook, Sir They saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
Stuart?
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
Choose your targets men. That's right Watch those markers. 55
Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45
