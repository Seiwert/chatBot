Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
Tons
They do not!
Hi, Joey.
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
What do you think?
What's normal?
But you hate Joey
You did what?
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
You burn, you pine, you perish?
He seems like he thrives on danger
I thought you hated those people.
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Yeah -- we'll see.
Don't make me do it, man
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She kissed me.
You get the girl.
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
Away.
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
A deal's a deal.
Are you lost?
Just a little.
That's never been proven
Does it matter?
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
My mission in life.
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.

I'm fine. I'm
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
You know what they say
Busy
Then why'd you ask?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
You 're so --
Unwelcome.
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
I hate peas.
Why not?
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
Enough!
No, Daddy.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
Good enough.
Just for now.
I'm likin' you guys better
With the teeth of your zipper?
Dr. Ruth?
But -- who -- what --?
Absolutely not.
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
I am, Your Eminence
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
The Judgment is ours!
Yes... I remember...
This time with me!
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Chief says...
Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
That's what it says.
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
So was Christ!
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
Colon!  Don't!
Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
Give me absolution.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
Surely you can do anything you want.
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
We don't need to know.
You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
You will regret this.
And what do you think Mendez?
Twenty eight.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
The land is there.  I know it!
You're right.  Let the men decide.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
You bring the cigarettes?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
No.
So you were never a prostitute?
I know.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
Vodka tonic.
You ready?
A timer.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Good.  Good.  Commendable.
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
This isn't homicide school.
Better than one.
Something back home?
Raw deal.
Just a shower?
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
There are two bodies found at this point.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Alright?
I'm not.
Answer the phone.
Well, that's great.
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
I'm not moody.
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
Yes.
Is there a problem?
How long are you planning to stay?
New York's finest.  This is his case.
Yes.  Both.
I want to document my trip to America.
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Put the camera down, Oleg.
Cut!
I want to hear everything he said.
That's what it looks like to me.
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Okay, come on down.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Are you reasonably awake?
Sure, Dave, what's up?
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
Yes, it is, Hal.
Did they have any explanation for this?
Thank you, Daddy.
Well, where are all of you off to?
Well, that does sound very odd.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
I will if I can, Frank.
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
How about chargin' the battery?
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
Here's hoping, baby...
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
Now you're talkin'. See ya...
I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
I got a lot to protect.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
I think you better put him on ice, man.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
Jesus.
Not likely, convict.
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
Musta got some primo bondsman.
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
You stay with me...
You sure that's the reason?
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Don't worry about it.
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
So do you...been a long day.
I'm heading out. How about you?
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
What's wrong with that?
What'd you do?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
Jack?  What was that?
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
Where is he?
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
This ain't a credit business.
Napoleon... small.
I'm fucked!
It means, "Never without my permission".
That's what I'm saying.
And then?
Yes..thank God..
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
Hey bud! Finger here.
I was talking to the cat.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
Leeloo..
...'Scuse me?
Vito Cornelius?
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
Yeah, very big, a giant.
Got it...
I'll be right back.
It's like a cab isn't it?
Fuck it! Hold tight!
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
I thought you were divorced.
Learning language.
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
Apipoussan!
You know women normally change five times more than men.
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Because...
I love you...
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
Uh..
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
...What do you mean?
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
Options.
I'm about to, Mr. President.
Only too well... here you must be parched..
Yes, Sir!
No... not at all.  Where are you?
Do you know how much I missed you?
I love you.
I understand.
I know.
It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
You don't understand...
I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
There's nothing harder.
What you see is what I got, mister.
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
Dino...
Is it?
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
I remember him.
We do.
I'm not so sure about this.
Any good?
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
Fuck you!
What the fuck do you want from me?
Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
You enjoy it?
Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
Easy enough for you.
Shut your mouth and drive!
Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
Yeah... guess so.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
I don't know, where are yours?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
It's their Presidential Suite.
It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
My condolences.
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.
You're joking.
Neil... Neil Cole.
No.
It got to be too much for him.
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
We're all like that.
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
Will you let me look?
You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
Yes.
I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
Who is this... ?
No... no... no...
He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Kristen...
Kristen's story really got to her.
You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
Alright, I think I see salvation...
Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
About Freddy?
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
You just stay put.  You need rest.
It's okay, Dan
It's lonely in there, in my room.
How did you know that?
My friend, with the funny hand.
It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
To take a picture.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
Alice...
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
If they actually bothered to bury her.
So did Dan.
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
That's their problem.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
Makes you look like a nun--
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Two hours a day, six days a week.
I can't listen to this.
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
So they caught up with you, too?
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
I guess.
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
You know - it <u>is</u>?
We'll have to look for them later.
I'm with <u>you!</u>
Oh it does???
I...don't know!
What???
Anything ---
Under <u>water</u>?
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
That's what I said!
Nothing we can do, now.
Your friend was to remain where he was!
I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
Thank you.
All right - go to it.
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
Twombley involved?
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
Yeah?
What happened?
Yeah.
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
Yes.
Yes.
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
No.
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
I figured you already heard.
You mean Twombley?
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
Where's Jill?
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
Yeah.
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
Tonight. Let's get together.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
Good.
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
Think they're alright?
Wade.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
Can --?
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
What?
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
Where... how'd you hear that?
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
His office. You mean my old office.
A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
She's coming.
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
How was she?
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
Want to know what I think happened?
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
That's what you think.
Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
I'm sure he's busy.
I'm sorry, honey.
Some kids were teasing you?
Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
Hey, you guys back already?
Alice... I...
Did we warn them off?
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
You read my mind.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
To swear you in as President.
Where are we now?
No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
Stand by.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
A dubious distinction, no?
Thank you.
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
You'll do it?
Good. Good.
Hold on, Alice.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
They've gotta be joking.
Yes, sir.
And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
What?
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
This is the President.
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
Commissioner.
That just doesn't make any sense.
Commissioner, Aquarius.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
There's nothing wrong with me!
If that's the way you want it.
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Set!
I mean for Ted.
I'm so excited, Simon.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
I think so.
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
A b...
Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
Thank you. Cream?
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
No. I'm all alone.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Well...not for another two hours.
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
Well...
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
And a little ice.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
You promise you'll write.
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
I'm Randy.
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
Here?
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
Nothing.
Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
Stay back!  I'm okay.
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
When will Strader return?
In the other man's rectum.
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
You look very good.
No... two.
Who else can I ask around here?
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Talk to me, Hudson.
Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
Yes.  That follows.
Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
Thirty-eight...simulated.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Alive?
Not that tunnel, the other one!
Let's get these things lit.
Fuckin' A!
On my way.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
We didn't miss anything.
Stand back.
Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
You're just reading me.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
What about me?
You promise?
You're really something, ace.
Why do they tell little kids that?
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
Wah...?  Where are...?
Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
That's right.
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Indeed.
In a harem.
What?
You were sublime.
Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
Sir -
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
I want to go back to Vienna.
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Em iram! Em iram!
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
Don't be stupid.
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
No!
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
Oh, Stanzi.
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
I'm not telling you.
Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
What for?
But! I'm a married woman!
I was at hand.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.
Not at all.
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
Oh, yes.
In three months! Papa.
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Be careful!
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Ah-ha!
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
Your Highness.
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
And the result satisfies.
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
No, no, please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
Twenty-six.
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
I have no idea.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Am I not welcome?
Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
Yes.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Oh, let's not talk about it.
Really? What is it he's writing?
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Madame.
Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
But this is absurd!
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
How could I not?
What work?
How much?
Are you neglecting my request?
I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
I think so.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
I'm not leaving you.
But, Your Majesty -
Just let me tell you how it begins.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
Italian?
Never mind.
About the ballet.
Did we?
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
Who is she?
Excuse me, my dear.
Yes, I am looking after him.
The American? Yes, duck.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
Yes, Doctor.
Come to my office, Miss Price.
What did he say?
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
The zoo? Is he rational?
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
Yes, Doctor.
No, a cab will be faster.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
Will you give me a break?
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
I know.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
I'll let you know the next full moon.
Your dead friend Jack?
Lovely.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
I'm freezing.
The zoo?
Don't you remember?
I should be committed.
Jack is dead!
No.
No.
Has he been refusing food?
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
What time is it?
What are you going to see?
Do you have bad dreams, too?
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
So they said.
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Shall we?
You ask them.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
It's circling us.
Walk away, Jack.
Yeah.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
What?!
I wanted to see you.
Yes.
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
Hi, David.
Thank you.
What about the zoo?
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
He's on the telephone.
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Aw, nerts!
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
Yeah.
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
Yes, sir.
What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
That's very simple. I was home.
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
You understand?
All right, Jack, all right.
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
I haven't got it.
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
What is?
My apartment.
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
Good for you. Come on.
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
Now?
Oh, yeah?
Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
John, how's your wife this morning?
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Yes, sir.
Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
I haven't any.
Yes, sir.
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
Yes, sir.
Did you get the case for the securities?
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
Matt, come here!
Oh, is that so?
With what?
A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
Are you sure?
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after—
Yes.
Jim Younger, I told you--
Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
... Will Perry ...
Hey!
One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
Tell me.
I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
I'm thinking...
Strategically.
Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
What do you think?
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
So what was he?
He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Shush.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
Mmmm.
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
Stop it. This is just sad.
You are a hell of a woman.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
Fair enough.
Thank you.
Right here in church?
I guess so.
This time we'll make an exception.
Move you fools!
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
THEN WHO DID?!
I look forward to seeing it.
Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
Stop it. I'm...
Nice?
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
Turn the light on.
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip –  to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
You and...Luis?
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Do...what.
No-I can't take the time off work.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
We never really shared one.
I have to return some videotapes.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
What exactly do you mean?
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
It's just not.
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
Patrick?
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
Two at nine? Perfect.
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
Yes, Patrick?
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
No, not really.
Who's Ted Bundy?
What's that?
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
Sorry. 
What are I doing?
No. Flattering, but no.
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
Well, maybe he did, huh?
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Oh.
People just...disappear.
Great, yes, I'd like that.
But Marcus denied it?
I checked it out. It's clean.
Where was Marcus?
So who was he with?
I'm so hungry.
I'm hungry.
Yeah, well, you're late.
Another Martini, Paul?
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
Yes, it is.
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
Isn't that -- extreme?
Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
You can't just walk in, either.
It's gonna get cold.
You're just afraid to eat it.
Prick.
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
What'd they ever do for you?
He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
We tried!
Oh hi.
He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
Low enough to relay internet traffic.
Skywire.
What're you implying.
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
You look a little tired.
'Have a look?
I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
There may be a little less trust after your outburst.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
Let's go.
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
Got out of my other commitment.
I'm calling Gary.
...Something like that. Yeah.
You're compulsive.
The Day Care?
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
Before they kill somebody else, too.
And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
What?!
I don't know.
Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
Where is he?
You may.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
Good luck, Austin.
Yes?
Yes?
Oh, and Austin...
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
That's not your mother, that's a man!
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
Thanks.
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Austin, I have something for you as well.
Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
I beg your pardon?
I'm sorry?
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Here, use mine.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
Do you want to talk to him?
No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
I am not.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
Do you think she's prettier than I?
Yes.
Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
Likewise.
That's not mine.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
Sure.
Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
What are you saying, son?
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Dr. Evil?
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
Yeah. What?
Scott, don't say that...
He's asleep.
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
Well, it's kind of weird.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
... bottle ...
... love ...
Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.
Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
Sir August...?  What now?
Eh? In here!
If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
We have met ...
Then who wins?
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
Ropes?
Valentine, listen to me ...
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
What are my choices?
I'll never marry you.
I had a spot of bother at the door.
1922. Why the kippers?
And just what is the game?
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
As per mother's instructions.
For a man in my position --
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
Did you say formal? I must dress.
She had this in her mouth. There, there...
Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
But if someone miniaturized the process...
Barely.
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
You don't trust me?
I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
It's called Black Leather.
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
What kept you?
Still a bit chilly ...
Decontamination -- ?
Who's now vanished.
Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
I fail to see --
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
I shall need a small plane.
Possibly. Split personality ...
Both, actually.
You wish.
Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
You're kidding.
What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
When do the girls get to the party?
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
Five thousand dollars.
Not interested.
I'm marrying Debbie.
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
Oh, come on, just a little.
I'm very happy for you two.
Maybe it had something to do.
But how can I do that?
Keep me informed.
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
Yes, sir.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
What's the matter?
Gonna get married...
Can't I just go with you guys?
I am committed. I love you.
Yes...
Yeah.
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
Ilene, Rick promised...
Ilene, we don't really know that.
A real turd.
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
Screw that.
Yes.
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
I want women.
I'll take some.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
It's Bullwinkle.
It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
You can tell a man by his friends.
No, Brett, I...
I'm separated.
I don't know.
Who's your friend?
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
You got it.
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
I don't know.
Yeah...
-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
Just come down, John. Just --
Who asked you?
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
What are we going to do about this?
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
Jennifer.
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Really? No kidding.
When I was twenty.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
Yes.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
Then who --
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
Glass?
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
Yeah.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
Nice boat.
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
It's in my blood, Willy.
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
Cute.
-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
Here we go...
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
The great communicator.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
I need that report, Lt.
Investigator Rimgale.
She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
Who?
Yes.
Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
Me?
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.
Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
How about 7 1/2?
Are you sure?
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
You've really got a problem.
Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
Did he gots to be.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats.
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
You ain't happy about the green light?
Must be the pressure.
What are you talkin' about?
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
Go on.  Good so far.
So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
I don't know about that plantation angle.
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
Dunwitty, don't leave.
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
I didn't mean that, in life.
Your father is proud of you.
Manray!
You getting cold feet?
Hello.
The pleasure is mine.
Everybody shut up.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
I don't want to hear it.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
Yeah.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
Where is he?
Not at all?
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.
This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
And this is my very best friend Mantan.
You tellin' the truth.
...I heard different, thought that was...
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
What do you want to know?
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
My people love me.
Y'know what?
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
And what?
That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.
Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
Only the agency of servants.
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
Have you not a man whom you value?
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
Agreed.
Then you must get it.
With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Yes, of course.
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
Yes, papa.
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
And he doesn't care about me?
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
We found him like this --
HEY!
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
Okay.
I'm serious --
Yeah --
Jesus!
Do what?
And the bodies?
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
The creek bed --
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Yeah...
That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
But not the only victim, right?
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
I didn't kill him --
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
No. I said Dunbar.
I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
I didn't do anything --
Because I was standing next to him.
Maybe he...
And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
I'm not gonna let that happen.
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
That's horseshit and you know it.
What are you talking about?
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
Got it.
Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
I lied. Wait for it...
I don't think that has anything to do with --
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
You couldn't have known --
You wanted to get the truth.
Right back where we started.
Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
Really.
Think it'll work?
Want company?
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
The faggot speaks.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
Oh, you remember now --
What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
Fifty minutes.
No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
Wait --
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
Then it's unofficial.
I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
No --
He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
Sir, yes, sir!
Edward Bloom.
Yes.
No one's ever left.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
I know.
Please?
Really?
Did you do any of that?
Really.
What did he say?
Really.
There's a lot you don't know about me.
I will.
Oh, so you know.
I think someone hasn't.
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
They're your favorite flower.
Go out with me.
There is no softer ground than town.
You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
Hello.
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
You don't have to.
Did you?
That's because most of it never happened.
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
He's up with your father.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
Of course.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
Yes. Thank you.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
There's over eighty thousand here.
Thank you.
Name it.
No I haven't.
Right.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
You're asking for my documents?
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
Good night.
What? What does he want?
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Happy bath day.
Syevodnya
What's wrong?
It's makes it easier. Okay.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
No I don't.
No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
Have you got your passport?
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
But, you know, so what?
Okay we won't talk about it.
And. It's wrong.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
Sometimes neither.
Why?
You didn't mind too much.
Get out
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
She's dead.
Laugh it up.
Goodbye.
It's not mine either.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
Cash.
You take her to a doctor?
Oh, she older than that.
Can I come in?
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
You gonna miss your bus.
You been home yet?
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
Yeah.
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!
Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her.
GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
How long... how long I been out?
Two days?
Why you got me chained?
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
Itches.
I don't fuckin' cook.
Sure.
We drinkin' buddies now?
I'm here with you.
Nothin'.
Don't think that'd be wise.
Looks like you know a song.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
Word wit'cha. In private.
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
Huh?
This Rae... you get with her?
You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
Don't know if God wanna see me.
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
Not like that.
We ain't here to talk about that shit.
Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
Rae don't do this now...
Yeah, I know.
Yeah?
Ronnie...
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
All that shit's on aisle 5.
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
Thanks.
Get rid of it.
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
Beats forty hours on a plane.
Go to sleep, Charlie.
Let's grab some food.
I don't think he'd feel it.
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
Connie...
I can see that.
If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
I want to yank Kobo.
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
Kampai.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
I couldn't tell.
A wife.  She left.
Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
He's on duty.
I don't remember you saying no.
Who am I supposed to be?
What if I chant?
Guess I'm on a roll.
I'm amused.
This by this...
Yeah.
What?
Right.
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.
If he won't cooperate?
Where?
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Had in mind something a little more radical.
Why?
You're androids.
Like what?
Hello, glad to meet you.
There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.
Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
You didn't like her!?
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
Got it.
Shot of vodka, please.
My pleasure.
Prosit.
I like you too.
I don't know.
Four years.
I'm taking a piss.
Meaning?
Yeah?
True.
Never been more sure of anything in my life.
Too old.
Yes?
What did she want?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
What's suck night?
Sorry.
I bet I would.
You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
I think you need more help than you've got.
What do you want me to do?
What?
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
What difference will it make?
Black?
If she is, the machine works.
Five, maybe six.
Discreetly.
Don't move.
I keep a lot of provisions right here.
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
Come where?
For how long?
I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
Young man, stop right there!
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
Oh, that's nice.
Yes, I'm right?
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
You don't?
Get away from me!!
Yes.
I haven't brushed yet.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Why?!
No dogs, huh? Okay.
That's what I was afraid of.
Yes, ma'am!
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
Um-hum.
Wow.
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
Eve, I'm sorry.
Yes, Eve?
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
Yes, sir.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
Your mom made that all by herself.
Merci!
I'll try.
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
Uh, I think they have.
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
I just don't want to.
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
Thirty-five.
Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
Oh, you got a problem with that?
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
The locks.
I told you! I've got everything!
Honey?
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
And I made these!
Excuse me.
To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
What are you doing here?
You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
Oh, yes.
Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
Well, that's blunt!
Yes, you do.
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Yes?
It's blue. Blue velvet.
Yeah.
Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
Jeffrey.
Well.
Then you got undressed.
Never before this.
No. Come on.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
Yes.
Yes.
No, please. I won't.
Yes, I like you.
Yeah, hurry up though.
I, uh.
Frank? Can you stand up?
No.
Please, please stay.
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
I did. Are you?
I want you to stay with me.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
No.  Hi baby.
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
You want to see him too, right?
If you want to.
Speak to me Fucker.
What?
For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Alright.
Of course, Jeffrey.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Still, it must be kinda rough.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Two.
I'll drink to that.
Why not?
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
He got a little jealous.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
What is it?
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
I can't dance fast.
No.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Go ahead.
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
Yes mother.
This is a six-shooter.
Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
What happened?
Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
I-I'll tip her.
I know what the fuck he looks like!
What?  What, that guy?
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
We're here brother.
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
Fuck!
Aye.
Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
A bit.
Just like on TV.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
Okay then... let's get ya started.
Where's my cat?
You... oh god, why?
It was... It was...
The fat man.
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
No way they could have seen it?
Eight.
Witness?
I...
Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.
We promise.
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
Hey, Murph.
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
You feel?
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
Thank you, Father, thank you.  Whatever. Goodbye, amen.
God have mercy on my soul.
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
Fuck you Vincenzo.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
No. This is he.
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
Just turn right here.
You think we're going to be chased?
Nothing. Go ahead.
We know there's another stocker.
Like he meant it.
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
On the left.
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
Yes... It's true.
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
OK.
Would of been nice.
Shh.
Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
I know.
Shut up!
Ah. Couple days ago.
Let me feel that.
I'm sorry, Bob.
Any activity?
Stand by, Bird Dog.
It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
Come on, Kumar.
Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
I'm not kidding.
We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.
We're not sure.
Oh, I'd say about --
He stole a tractor.
Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
What do you mean?
That sounds like Dignan.
I don't want to die.
Yeah.
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
See you, Bob.
He looked too shaken-up.
I'm not playing any more golf.
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
No, I don't mind.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Why do you say that?
No. I wasn't adopted.
You're Anthony?
The front stairs.
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
True.
Bob! Get back in position!
So who's going to know?
You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
I told you he's crazy.
I warned you, Dignan.
Maybe she turned.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
See you in a little while.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
We'll have to see when we get back.
Come on, Dignan.
You don't even know his name.
Anthony. Bad news.
Not bad.
Not a whole lot, Bob.
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
Here we go.
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
He's damn good.
Well, I left some money in there.
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
Got a little lucky.
Mr. Henry?
What do you mean?
Save it for Bourne.
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
Did he say anything to you?
Don't know.
The sooner the better.
It was staged?
Lots of people...
Yes...
Felt a little light.
I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
Conklin up front.
No. There's nothing new.
I should be better by now.
But it ends up the same.
The Telegraph office.
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
-- where? -
What if it's not who you think it is?
There must be another way!
You do?
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
What is this, a game?
Your first assignment was Geneva.
I was here!
Bourne?
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
Sounds like a threat.
Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
Who's going? Us?
Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
-- the hotel -- how far? --
What?
Here?
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
So?
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
Are we hacking or asking?
And what about you, anything?
It was in Latin, sir.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
He will. I know he will.
The Scots will fight for us?
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
Aye.
I wanna have supper waitin'.
I will not.
No. He did not.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
Humbly, M'lord.
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
Thank you for inviting.
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
How do you know this?
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
It's battle I want, not talk.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
I must... consult with my father.
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
But you must have something to go on?
The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
What? What could he do?
Can you protect me?
Straight up.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
Not in this wing, actually. No.
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
I see a car.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
Where are my goddamn books?
My journals! Where are they?
Photos?
Like Ozzy.
What the fuck are you doing?
Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
Hi, Lenny.
I've stopped a hundred times.
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
What do you mean?
Like how?
I walk differently?
I get it. You can drop it now.
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
Why's that?
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
...yes.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
Who's to say you can't make things better?
We'll find out soon enough.
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
Gee, thanks friend.
Y... yes. I guess I did.
What happened?? Where are we?!
I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
I'm sorry.
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
Oh, yes, please.
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Thank you, but I hardly think --
I'm sorry. It is.
As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
Er, good luck, yes.
It has been a pleasure to meet you.
It's not for sale.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
Good day.
I will.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
No.
All except one. He won't have you.
No.
Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
Apparently he has the letters.
I love you very much, my dear.
Of course, I'll be careful.
Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
How do you do?
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
Yes, I get the point.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
We'll be there.
If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more "persuasive methods" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.
Good day.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they "blundered" into Berlin in 1918.
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
But everybody's having such a good time.
But I have no excuse to close it.
Ask Monsieur Rick.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
Huh!
Our entertainment is enough.
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Why two?
That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
Huh?
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Sacha, she's had enough.
-- Sacha, call a cab.
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
Put it down!
Hello Ugarte.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
Feels so good to lie here.
Do too much, I'll die.
Going to die anyway.
Survive today, that's the point.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
Why do they have to die for me?
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
There was an unavoidable delay.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Well, I do a little drawing --
He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
You smell like formaldehyde.
Not if you work for FedEx.
You don't seem too happy about it.
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
I can't take him to work.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
Yes there is.
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
Is that Jango?
That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory.  And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
Not when you have no choice.
That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
You too.
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
I'm doing fine.
There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
It was fifteen minutes late.
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.
You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
Want to see my raft?
I braided them.
Hallelujah.
Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
Better than I can!
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Good night, Daddy.
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
"King Kong". It's really good.
Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Right.
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
Mr. Rose *knows*?
You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
Well, they aren't.
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
Someone not from Maine.
Is that soon?
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
Okay...
Okay. Then you can be of use.
Where'd she get you?
We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
Of course.
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
That's it.
Now, now. He's a good boy.
*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
We see you next harvest.
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
He ain't never been outta Maine!
That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
And you have this letter of intent?
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.
No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
Just the last three weeks.
Isn't it always?
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
It's not true.
Today? Started off great...
Guess so.
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
So what? We just stay clear of him.
I told you, use less powder.
Well, this is just fucking great...
Tonight. Just me.
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
I'd like this cashed, please.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
No. Just confidence.
You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
I think two million.
Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
Something stupid.
Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
Very much so.
I'll worry about Customs.
Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
Why?
Then show me how.
Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
WHAT?
Glenn talked you out of it.
You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
Escorts!
I'm sorry.
You going to have the time?
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
Whaddya mean? We got dick.
Jack Manfred.
It's the tension.
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
I'll try and make it.
South African women are very sporty.
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
Not particularly.
Not entirely.
You mean I won't resist them.
I've got a job.
I don't know.
It's the truth.
It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.
There was a message, wasn't there?
Then what?
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
Well, thank you anyway.
Your father?
Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.
I'll watch.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
Then you're not a pro.
What kind of trouble?
It won't.
I can't do it, Jani.
What for?
Yes.
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
Are you going to put a spell on me?
How long have you worked at the casino?
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
I don't gamble.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
No.
We check every four days.
Any exceptions?
Give me 365.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
No.
All right, Mr Reynolds.
Does he win?
What flickering light?
Oh. What's wrong now?
I think he's talking to it.
Key?
Oh, God...
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Energy shielding positive function.
Armed.
Hello, bomb.
Hey, bomb.
Bomb?
In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
I have no proof that it was false data.
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
I'll check it.
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
Which one?
Any planets?
-- Remark.
I like it up here.
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Not now!
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
Yeah?
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
Yeah, sure, I understand.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
What're you talkin' about?
What the hell are you doing?
None of your business.
Where?
Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
I don't get involved with guns.
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
SHHH!  Don't do that!
They took my daughter.
Hello...
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
Logan Cale.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
I won't be staying.
Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
That would be appropriate, yes.
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
How well do you remember the lab?
How much do you know?
A girl.
Your help.
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
We're quoting Mom again.
Zack... He made it... He's alive...
A friend of your fiance's.
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
You're also a fool.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
You're crazy.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
What guys do.  'Nother order.
I just don't go in with any expectations.
You know what I'm saying.
How long you and me known each other?
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
I actually know how this works.
She's gonna want to hear for herself.
I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
Tell everybody hey.
Max--
I'm the victim here.
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
Shut-up...
I was on call. 
How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
Gin.
My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
It's okay.
What's it worth to you?
What? That's disgusting!
Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
What's in Sandusky?
Disco blows dogs for quarters.
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
One more time in English.
Plenty, but it was all bad.
I've been in love with her since the second grade.
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
The paint!
Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
Nah. Couldn't be.
Oh, yeah...?
Sure.
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
What's gone?
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
The KISS Army!
Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!
Good morning...
GOOD MORNING!
He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
So... that's it?
Like a spear.
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
I don't wanna talk about it.
Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
That's easy. Antiseptics.
You mean soap?
Until it withers away.
Yeah?
And what?
You want to kiss me...
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
But you're OK?
Why? Is this about the book?
Yeah...
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
That is a terrible nickname.
Do you get to meet Ed?
Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
Frank.
Gretchen. We're going together now.
Four times... so far.
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
No. That makes you keep searching.
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
I... I was playing with fire.
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
Why?
Where are we going?
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
Frank is going to kill.
Where is he, Donald?
You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Congratulations.
What I think is going on with your son.
Frank?
You're not a bitch.
If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
It is a big deal.
Beg pardon?
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
She's alive, sweetie.
Oh God, I'm dead...
Oh-yah.
Thank God for bunge cords.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
Huh?
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
We all do. Now let's go.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
NO...  It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
Then it must be Wednesday.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit.
My dress'll reek.
The important thing is that we have a winner...
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
"Proud... to be... an... American."
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
The king can do no wrong! 
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
About - thirty-four seconds.
He could be playing solitaire, but I don't think so.
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Yankee Poodle.
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
Fine.  We gotta him. 
If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited.  I'll put my foot down; So shall it be - This is the land of the free.  The last man nearly ruined this place He didn't know what to do with it.  If you think this country's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The treasury is low on dough; The last man went and flew with it.  If you think we're short of money now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The country's taxes must be fixed - And I know what to do with it, If you think you're paying too much now, Just wait 'till I get through with it. 
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
You swine!
You worm!
Yes.
I don't remember.
You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 
Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
I've always thought that myself.
I'll join you shortly.
No, I think a whiskey.
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
I'll show you! I'll show you!
He fell.  He falls.
Everything will be seen to.
You don't own this man!
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
Good morning, sir.
Indeed!
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
Yes sir.
Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
Do you think they'll go along with us?
Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
I feel much better. Thank you.
I am very pleased to meet you.
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
No, but I certainly shall.
Good day, Mr. Merrick.
Yes.
Yes.
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
Righteousness...
Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
Oh, our relatives... the children.
Yes, John.
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Then I shouldn't change anything?
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
No, he's very upset about something.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
Never mind. I'm the owner.
Ah! It's my father!
Who, Father?
There IS no one.
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
Yes.
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
It was different...
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
"The fifth one this week"!
I'll bring it back.
It was my master Keitel's idea.
We blew the Horn Resounding.
No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
You've got to let me go!
They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
Yes.
You don't love ME.
You DON'T like it, do you?
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
What a stupid idea.
Well... no...
Find it... AND cross it!
Very deep... usually...
I met this girl...
She got me thinking...
Sorry.
You'll see!
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
I've got you!
Who gets killed?
How about making friends?
What is it?
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
We haven't got a spare place.
Let me do something for myself for a change!
What do we have to do?
He hasn't.
Your lord.
I... I...
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
What have you got there?
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
That's right.
Well... I... I thought...
Help!
Stop it!
Dad!
No... he's not... not... there...
Yes, Mum.
No, Mother.
Just a little overworked, maybe.
No one.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
Yeah, I got it.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
I don't know what that means.
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
That's okay.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
Yeah?
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Very much.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
Yeah?
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
Yeah.
That's scary sounding.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
When?
You're not ready.
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
Yeah, Tangerine?
I don't know.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
Okay.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
I love her.
Female.
Oh, um...
Hey, Joel --
I don't know.
I can't stop thinking about you.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
Guess what I'm wearing.
Hi.
The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
Well... I did.
It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
Sorry. I just --
'kay.
We haven't checked.
Well, what should we do?
How did I look?
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
He went home sick.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
Then check the connections.
Yeah.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
I know who you are.
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
I don't.
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichés and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
American Cheese. The king of road food.
Yep.
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
A job for me?
I don't know anything about it.
I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.
Don't start with me, Cooper.
Hold on, Coop...
You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
I'm telling you, I saw it...
Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared.
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
Oh God...
A power drain --
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
Thank you.
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
What's on your mind?
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
Justin. I won't let you die.
No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
What you got, Peters?
Alive?
Skipper...
Do it.
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
It's complicated...
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
What do you want me to say?
I don't know...
You can't, your orders are specific...
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
What makes you think I'll miss?
Then who the fuck are you?
Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
Do it. Dr. Weir...
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
...repeat, we're armed...
He's been past Mars?
DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
Can you shut it down?
Keep him talking.
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
All boards are green, everything's five by five.
Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
Get them back --
Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
I can't believe we built this.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
Victor did.
Is it safe?
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
It's easy for you to be patient.
Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
This makes five.
Victor's better at these things.
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Ben. Are you okay?
Yeah, nine years straight.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Go back to the drawing board.
What do you mean "complete"?
That's terrible news...
I can go hotter!
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Right, whatever, have fun.
But all these people...
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
You gave us names? What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
Showtime.
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
I gave him twenty.
I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
Why didn't you say something?
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Sure.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
Oh, I think you already have.
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
It's the first door on your left!
Later.
No. I want my money back right now.
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Why can't you do it?
Your friends use the pool too.
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Yes, sir.
Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
Oh, really?
So are you.  Are you shaking?
Let's continue.
What? Are you all right?
I know it's yours.
You should work for yourself.
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
Really.
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
You're crazy. Those girls love me.
Whatever you say, Rat.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
I've been swimming, Merv.
That's me, Merv.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
No. But it's a nice idea.
Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
I don't know. Wherever you want.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
What about those other guys you live with?
Not at all.
Two more Cokes.
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Two Cokes.
Awake? What do you mean?
Righto!
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
Crying? Why was she crying?
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there...
Not much. Why?
GO?
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport.
It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
They were all veterans.
Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.
Lucy is looking for you.
I could already feel the stuff working on me -- the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine -- maybe I should take a swim, I thought...
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?
Of course, officer.
I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
They'll get in! We'll all die!
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
We're going to get my little girl.
Where is everyone?
I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
With what just happened upstairs --
We're lucky to be alive.
"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
Follow me.
No. You?
Oh yeah?
My truck.
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
What's in the back?
But not flush against the tunnel?
No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
I can't feel a thing, Hon.
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Fully.
Covered.
Get outta here.
Oh? And what's that?
They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
F-f-fuck you.
You smell like ass!
Clear!
Gimme the keys.
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
YOU'LL HIT US!
That's fine.
Wait God-dammit!
Not without you!!!
That's one piece of four problems.
I'll do anything to help.
I think --
Um, well...
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
Who's this?
Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
I'm not!
God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
Thank you.
I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
Claire?
Fired?
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
But I'll never win that.
He's a socialist, then?
I know.
And you think it's worth all this?
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
Please, Francie...
Thank you.
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
I wouldn't miss it.
Then don't go to Hollywood.
They'll mend.
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
Enh.
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
Calm down, Frances.
Frances...
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
Who said I was a lady?
Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
What's that?
Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
I love you too, Frances.
Oh Harry...
I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
No.
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
What'd you do?
Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
Fine!
I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
'Golden Boy.'
Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
Your big speech?
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
...You will.
Smile, little sister, smile.
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
Go on...
Not long.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
Mama...?
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which... 
Please sit down...
Stay calm, please.
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
No!
You're kidding.
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
People can be kinder than you think.
Kill me and have done with it.
Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
Yes. I want this over and done with.
I will not! Kill me now!
He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  Fellow..."
So have I
Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
Is he not back yet?
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
Is that what makes it so delicious?
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
Only you.
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
So do I.
Why the change? What about your work?
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
Aye, Captain.
But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
No. He had more important work.
A... week?
No. They don't.
This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
I didn't find what I was looking for.
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
No, no, they're all dead...
Good night, Brenda.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
Sure.
I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
Un-hunh.
Absolutely.
Is it stuck?
Get behind him more.
Where's Ned?
God, but I love that sexy talk.
Whatever you make yourself.
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
Coach, athletic director somewhere.
Good call.
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
I call it my shower dream.
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
But it's in the brochure! "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program." You just saw it.
You've made a science out of coincidence.
Sure.
You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?
He's running the show.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
What's this about, money?
Come again?
Sorry, I need everybody.
Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.
Yes, she is.
Yes.
You won't let him touch her?
Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
Scott?
Sure.
Where are you taking us?
What you said to me in the room.
You asked me if I would --
The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
-- you got your shower --
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
Sight seein'.
Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
I did?
Really?
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
We are?
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
No, Richie, what do I look like?
Where are you right now?
He needs our help!
That's what I hear.
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
Thank you, sir.
No, sir.
The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
Motherachrist...
Fuck me.
Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.
Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point...
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Yes, dear.
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
Sounds familiar.
I'm sure it is.
Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!
You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
This has nothing to do with you.
Which is guy-speak for...
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
What?
That's a good story.
He was married?
I think you look beautiful.
Sure, sure.
Maybe half.  Not even.
It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?
Shut your hole, Slutnik.
Great. See ya then.
You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
Oh yes he will.
But we can get to the west side faster.
You must have quite some harem.
I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
Oh my God! They're coming!
Oh, just some insurance guy.
Speak of the devil.
Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
What do I get?
It's your choice.
We? I don't think so.
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
No. Perhaps I work too much.
More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.
I'll try.
Have them sealed off.
Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
You don't have the authority to do that.
Oh.
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
Sure.
Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
How do I do that?
I'm... I'm shot.
I won't and nothing you say-
Nothing.
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
Why didn't you stop at the market?
The ships are gaining...
FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
Nobody was WATCHING?
What?
We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
It's okay. Listen-
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
Okay...  Okay, now what.
Yes Commander?
Yes?
What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
Yeah, what is it?
No. Keep all energy to the armor.
We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.
You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
Jason..
It helps.
No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
Gwen...
Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
Stop, please! I don't know!
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
But there it is!...
Wh... Where are we?
Push It. Hold it down.
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
How about the pig-lizard?
Get oacK on their tail.
Because they're coming right at us.
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?
Same old story.
That can't be.
Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
Cut those men down.  Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial.  Benedict, trust me to handle this.
That you would have known you can trust me.
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
Yes, general?
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
Delighted, sir.
Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!
To hell with Arnold...
I'm not sure.
As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men...
I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
Gag on your own invention, then.
You invented this, this...
We already have black soldiers in our army...
I understand, George.
I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
The man is a traitor!
What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
General Lee, sir!
I'm very aware of that.
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
What else?  From Virginia?
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
Martha!  For God's sake!
Yessir!
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!
It is; we need you George.
Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
That land belongs to the strongest.
Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions?  Because each of us is who we are:  we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change.  The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us.  And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature.
God damn you, Sam Adams!  You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we've really got one it scares you more than it does the British!
Juba was a Numidian.
Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
No shit? What're some of 'em?
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
That's right, me.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
Who?
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
That's all.
Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
I don't believe this.
Bear, you're not really gonna –-
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
That's the magic number.
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
Okay. So who are you?
Ray. Look at me.
Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
I'm a producer.
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
I know what a marker is.
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
That's right. As a matter of fact...
Once.
So what's the problem?
Read it. It's a grabber.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
You have it?
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Twenty seven hundred.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
You're not going to tell me the rest?
Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
I'll find you, Leo...
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons –-
...That's what we finally decided.
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" -– which by the way was a better book than a movie -– did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
Not yet.
There a part in it for you?
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
Depends, who pays?
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
You thought I was faking?
What happened?
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Shylock?
Hello, Martin.
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
Maureen?
Roger?
Or uninvited guests.
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
Right. Wednesday.
Why not?
Smugglers maybe.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
Sounds reasonable.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
Like I always say --
Three, four days.
Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
So whoever did this might still be around.
If they knew what they were carrying.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
Right.
Sorry.
Right.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
No.
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
Nope.
Did you see him?
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
What?
But, who -- ?
If it was a ship she hit.
Wish I could say the same.
Not our mystery guest again.
I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
We hit land.
I think I see it pretty well.
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
Looks like it's adrift.
Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
You're up late.
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
Drink up then.
You don't remember?
Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
Who?
How should I know?
What is it now?
I guess.
Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
Yeah, I heard about that.
I just buzzed him in.
Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you.
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
No, I'm serious. Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell.
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
Yeah, well... hi...
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
That's just the way I am!
Why do you have that stupid poster?
Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
Why?
Forget it...
Good.
Just look at them!
We should follow them!
Okay, okay!
God, it's so totally pathetic.
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
I remember every minute of that party.
Shh, it's his answering machine...  We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP.
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
Totally! Look!
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
Come on, it's too late now...
Gross!
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
What are you talking about?
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
It'll only take a second.
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
Where?
You cunt!
Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
Like what?
Which one?
...maybe we should be lesbos...
Fuck it. Everything must go!
Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
Yeah, I guess... call me...
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
What thing?
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
So should I come over?
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
I said "great"...
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
Maybe an orange juice.
It just came yesterday...
Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
Well, we won't keep you.
I thought it wasn't for sale.
Where did you get those pants?
Tell me what?
That's not even --
Norman.
Yes.
I did too!
Indian records?
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
Jesus!
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
Hooray for me.
You work at Cook's Chicken?
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
That's the spirit!
I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.
I won't even dignify that with a response.
Who knows?
So, what happened?
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
YAAA!
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
And you like them?
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
It's a tampon in a teacup...
Right, exactly!
I don't know... where is she, then?
On that pathetic fake blind date.
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
As are they all.
Am I to take it you want to live?
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
Then we agree. 
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.
Might be exciting for you.
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
What did I do?
Don't they have to be?...
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
Thank you, Samuel.
I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it.
Four should do it.
Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.
Good night, Janosz.
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
Oh, hello, Peter.
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
I don't know what to do anymore.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
Finally came to your senses, huh?
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.
What are you doing up here?
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
Too bad for the Moldavians.
My pleasure.
I know.
The Upper West Side.
Command me, lord.
Do I?
Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
Hello, Venkman.
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
And we're the ...
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
Something good --
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
No, the slime is rising.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.
Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12.
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
Spengler,  see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.
All right.
Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
We'll get back to you.
What is it?
I don't believe in luck.
Here are tonight's calls.
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
What have you got, Egon?
Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
Yeah, I can smell it.
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
I agree.
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
Oh, shit!
She said he was "the Destructor."
Get a grip on yourself, Egon.  I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.
I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too.
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company.
Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
Well, that ought to do it.
Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
And the seas would boil ...
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
Maybe you should get married.  Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability.
Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
If I may be so bold...
You're coming back?
The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
Do you want posters, too?
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
That's difficult to say, general.
Gladly Caesar.
If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...
I'm serious.
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
They can't... if this is Rome...
Only from a distance.
Sneaking around with your brother?
Why do you play at being drunk?
Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
"But what if I wish to be purple?"
There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.
I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
They're studying with Cynics.
I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
Death is... everything for me.  Now you have to go to your cell, and I to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well.  I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow!  I want all my gladiators to win and be happy!  Besides, I've never owned a Roman general before.
Lucky it didn't step on his head.
What the hell are you talking about, Greek?
I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
I'd love some.
No -- why should I?
Wait a minute.
Yes.
You do?
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Here he comes.
Because -- I am.
All right then! Yes!
What?
What did she say?
If you want.
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
No.
Yes.
I don't see how we can.
Well -- I said I might marry him.
Shhhh.
Hello -- who is this?
Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?
Thank you.
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
Ahhh.
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
I want you out of here.
I am going to call the police now.
Could you bring it up?
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
What?
Oh no.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
What do you drink?
When is he coming back?
No.
What's wrong?
Like what?
Well I don't know.
So?
Sit down.
Will you unzip my dress?
I know that. But I'm --
Right.
What if he did?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Get away from that door.
Jesus Christ!
Let me out!
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Of course.
Waiter!
I haven't. No.
Well -- I don't know.
That's fine.
The number.
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
Are you tired of it?
Well what do you want to talk about?
Neither.
No.
There!
I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
What?
We don't.
Is it?
See if you can guess.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
Not particularly.
Why are you asking me all this?
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
That's enough.
Why not?
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Now don't start this.
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
But if it's sickening for you --
You don't have to say that.
Thank you.
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
Very good, sir.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
Sure.
Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
I do.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
About what?
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
I've got to go.
You'll never be young again.
Quite a while.
Oh no.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
Mr. Robinson?
Don't shout at me, Ben.
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
Yes, I can.
I'd like to discuss this.
Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns.
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
The pearls are in her room.
No.
Why?
With the pearls?
What about the money?
You might find a bullet through that head...
All right. We'll dance.
Will you do me a big favor?
Would you like to make a man happy?
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
What do you want here?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
How tired you are!
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear -- 
You are beautiful!
Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
Oh -- yes but -- later.
Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
Yes, quite.
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win.  It's good, -- come along, Baron.
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
No, Doctor.
The Grand Hotel.
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
Yes -- that --
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
She's beautiful -- isn't she?
Yes.
I never danced before -- in public.
Oh -- what -- what -- 
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
Oh yes, of course.
Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
You pay me.
I got ten marks for that.
Moreover...
Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Hello!
Well -- you want me?
Well?
Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
Exactly.
Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
All you have to do is phone for it.
You've decided against the merger?
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
He likes to play the great man.
You haven't time.
I wish to be alone.
What -- what is it? Last night...
Good morning, Gru -- your --
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
I want to keep my teeth.
Bobo, no, I --
My son --
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
I will. So long, Bobo.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?
So here we are!
Can't move.
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
You know who I work for.
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
What is?
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
It's not your fault.
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
Lead on.
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
Bluebell came in?
Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
This way's perfect.
You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
And Myra's stuff?
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
Uh-huh.
Never.
I don't see why not.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
What?
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
You're too young. You should be in school.
Always, for you, baby.
All? It ain't bad.
You called the doctor, huh?
I want to know everything about you.
That's just Lilly's way.
Myra, I'm not following this.
Yeah? How?
That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?
Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?
Bullshit!
I'm happy the way I am.
Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
Happy to see you looking so good.
Charming.
The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
Detective...
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
What the fuck are you talking about?
I think someone broke into my house.
And miss the big game?  No way.
And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
No.
Nothing.
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
No.
I was trying to protect you from this...
Get on the bus.
Where'd you get it?
Can I come in?
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
Oh, right.  Sorry.
Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
Have enough fun for the both of us.
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
But I've seen him!
He says things.  Bad things.
Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
No -- please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
It's a rune ... Thorn.
Wait a minute ...
I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode -- Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night --
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
How all the magazines show tits today.
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
Tell them yourself!
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
The hell with the diamonds!
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
So long, Colonel.
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
Go home!
I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
The educational process.
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Sorry.
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
In what way, pray tell?
You.
You're an imbecile.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
The posies are for her?
I've considered that.
I just want one true adventure before I die.
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
Out!  Out!
He worships Father.
He insults him all the time.
What's good about that?
England?
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
I can't take my eyes off you.
Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
We thought a doctor might help.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
Say hello to your mother.
Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
You're wrong.
They don't have to feel like slaves.
No.
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
Yes.
If he wants to go.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
Just one favor.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
Rifle?
Blue soup?
If he thinks he's man enough.
I'm teaching my son to be a man.
What a handsome word.
Ah!  The lady is armed.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
Hello, Mother.
What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
I've never heard of it.
What for?
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
We'll find out now, won't we?
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
Poison.
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
I've enjoyed being man.
Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
Premature ejaculation.
That is sad.
Ja?
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
Don't!
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
Still lives with his mother.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
It's beautiful.
That man is your father.
Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
It is an emergency, isn't it?
Then get him.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
I'm glad.
I know.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
How long has this been going on?
I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
Tonight's the night.
It is?
Paul's only twelve years old.
He's not your son.
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
Not true.
Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.
You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
I don't really want... 'body to body contact.'
Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come.
But is she, has...
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Are you going to stiff me?
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
How many weeks?
What's that shade of blue called?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
Too bad. I wasn't in it.
Do you know where she would be?
Tod might know.
You're not a film producer, are you?
Three hundred?
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
Huh?
I don't drink, but you can go out.
No.
A friend.
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
What rate?
'Sucking off.'
You used to work at Copper Penny?
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
What do you care about?
He deals in pain.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
Fuck.
No, please go on.
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
You really believe all that?
I thought I was fucked up.
But what?
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
What do you mean?
No.
They are?
I don't know.
But the police...
Do you think she's safe?
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
That's not true, Mr...?
That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for.
I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
Where is she? Where is the girl?
Yeah.
You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
Who?
Ratan!
Let's go.
Film making can be pretty expensive...
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
You're taking a big chance.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
Yes, I am.
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
No, no. I just took it.
All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
Hello.
What kind of a car is it?
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
No, thank you. I have my car.
Your hearse?
No.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
Maude???!
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
Certainly a new experience for me.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
Well...
But what?
But this is public property.
No more revolts.
Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
Yes.
It's so blue.
Well, why don't you?
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Well, don't go.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
Maude.
I took them out.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
Harold!
Why?
Ah, yes.
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
Well, maybe one.
Yes.
Yes.
No.  I'd have liked to.
I'd have liked to talk to him.
War is not all black.
ZAT!
Yes.
Souvenirs?
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
I know.
Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go.
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
So you slept O.K.?
Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
The boxes! I TOLD you.
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
Are you crazy?
It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
What are you talking about? Who are you?
Yeah.
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.
No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --
What is it?
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
No. It was red. Bright red.
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
Is it bad?
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
Anung-un-Rama...
I can live with that.
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
Oh-n-no -- I --
No. I never was.
That's right, Stud, hold me down.
Red, I --
A brute.
What -- ?
Two steps back, please.
We're leaving.
Julia's my second wife.
Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
No!
To a man called Frank Cotton?
No. That wasn't the deal.
First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?
I don't remember.
One last time. Give me the box.
Poor baby.
Oh.
I don't want to see the dress.
Hurting.
Who?
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
What?
You promised me an explanation.
Hell...
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
You're still afraid.
Hi. I got soaked.
The keys are in the kitchen.
I have to see my father.
Like who?
The best part of ten years.
So what's the argument?
Oh Christ. Julia...
I hear you.
In here.
I cut myself.
Larry....
Just feeling a bit sick.
O.K.
It's better you see for yourself --
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
Do you care ?
What's wrong?
I won't be a moment.
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
I said: I found a room.
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
Call me tomorrow.
Sure.
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
So lie down.
I thought we'd lost you.
We walk.
She's so damn... English.
Are you alright ?
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
Will you GO, damn you?
Sure. Why not?
I don't know.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
He offended me with his terrible taste.
Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?
Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
Suck my ass.
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
How many tickets can I put you down for?
You're not even coming?
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
Laura.  Her dad died.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?
I have all of the others.
Do not get ahead of yourself.
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
We work there!
Nobody.
He's not worth it!
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
I'll tape it for you.
I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
Think about it, Rob.
I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
Hi.
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
I remember the song.  I just couldn't remember who sang it.
Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
I don't know.
What, what?
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
I guess.
Nothing.
I don't have your number.
You do, huh.
It's me.
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
You still together?  Going all right?
Mmm hmm.
Oh ho, so very infrequently.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
Pig died.
I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
Mmnn.
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?
What's the difference?
Okay.
You're tougher.
Harder.
No use.
Wanna go to dinner?
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?
Would you marry me if I was?
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
Well she --
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
Good.
Thank you.
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
How's the store?
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
Yeah.
Go to hell.
No thank you, I'm fine.
I don't follow you.
There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
Carl Smith.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
I've been to Church Hill.
Tradition.
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
Not your concern.
You?
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
Are you?
You had to do _nothing_!
Yes.
They do it each year.
It's beautiful.
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
He knows about you.
You killed those other two.
What about that family in '31?
Is that a threat?
No!
The inheritance.
You have lived forever.
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
What do you want from me?
Spare me the details.
It's that important?
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
I was nearly killed.
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
That is not me.
What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
Far away.
We need more time.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Figure she's with him?
We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
And the Bulgarian?
We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
Kahn?
Sit.
How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
Offered the Pope one of his whores.
He always did.
You're wrong.
Not so long.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
MACLEOD!
Leave her out of this.
This isn't done.  Get up.
No.
A mystery.
Where were you Tuesday night?
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
His only kid.
I'm getting married tomorrow.
I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
He certainly -- hic -- does!
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
I lost my wallet.
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Yes!
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
Oh.
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
So long.
Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
Get out of here, you!
Your luck's not with you now!
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
The power of the press, huh!
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
What?!!
I have a lunch date. I just want --
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
You bet I've got a better offer.
Dead?
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Get away, Svengali.
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
What's his line?
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Thank you.
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
I know, but --
Where's some paper?
All right, Walter.
What tickets?
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
What is it? Here!
Murder, uh?
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
You know you did!
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
I'm busy, Duffy.
What?
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
Yes, sir.
Three bullets! Any good?
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
What have you got, Hildy?
Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?
I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
Three sixes. Is that any good?
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
Little rum in yours, too?
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
Good coffee, isn't it?
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
What?
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
Yeah. But I --
No, I couldn't do that.
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this?
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
I did.  Hold the wire.
If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
Go on -- shoot me!
Now, Hildy --
I can't.
I'm telling you!
I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
I thought so, too.
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
Mother!
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
"Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
Isn't that her picture?
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
Ssh!
Forty dollars.
The what?
I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
Yeah?
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
Look out where you're aiming, will you?
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.
But Grandpa, you said...
Who told you that?
Won't they have maps?
Pauline.
He's the worst liar.
I'm starting my own collection.
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
Air-raid?
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
Kiss me Hardy.
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
You need trees for an avenue.
And absent bridegrooms!
Jam.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
Half the time he's bluffing.
It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
Grace!
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
Look after yourself, Grace.
Father, that's enough now
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
Yikes.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
What about R.J.?
Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
OK.
No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
You sure do a lot of guessing.
OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
Nice.
Fucking great.
Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
Way out here?
Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
Thanks.
I know, this is fucking nuts.
Here he comes.
He won't move.
Turn that fucking radio off!
Man, it's already ten thirty.
Where ya headed?
There's a dog in the road.
There's not enough room.
What?
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
Quiet.
That's nice.
Tickets for what?
I don't want to see that.
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
When?
I don't know, I think he's funny.
No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.
Sleeping.
I resign.
Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.
Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
Firefly.
Oh, you mean on TV.
Great.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
Huh?
What!
I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
Don't worry, I'm gone.
I um... no, I don't think so...
Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.
George Willis...  ...any leads?
Fit the profile?
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Shhhh... you hear that?
Yes, sir.
Dr. Satan?
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
We found one.
That is the wrong fork, young man.
Oui. Perfect!
Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
When you were a little French girl?
Shh.
Shit.  Hi, honey.
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
Stop. Get away.
You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
No. You look so beautiful.
No!
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
That's Lila?
We still have you and I.
Okay.
I want to be the way I was before.
Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason.
Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
Always. Ow.
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Lila, it's Rosie.
Shut up, you.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
You've got to respect that.
What's the larger experiment?
Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
No biggie.
Yes.  Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.
Of course.
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
Nothing. Be right out.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
No.
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
How come?
That was wonderful!
Oh boy!
Should I come with?
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to...
Unka unka unka unka unka.
I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Mm hmm.
Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
Next game, ten bucks.
I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
She's a smart girl, Eddie.
Do we need words?
You know what's good for him?
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
How?
It's possible.
The night is two thousand dollars old.
A thousand.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
In that case, you owe me another drink.
I told you. I got drunk.
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
Kiss off.
Miss Packard. How do you do?
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
Come on, let's go...
I said we're leavin'.
I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
Aaaahhhh!
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
What's your game? What do you shoot?
Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
I told you you'd get your money back.
What's the difference where? I'll raise it.  Is it all right if I have another drink?
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
Aw, Eddie.
What for? To play Fats again?
Glad to meet you.
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
Couple of bucks.
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
Since four.
Fair.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
Around.
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
Give me a drag.
You told me.
Museums... art galleries... concerts.
Mm hmm.
Eggs. How do you like them?
I've got something in my bag.
Haven't you opened it?
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
A loser?
Would he know?
I love you.
Yes, I'm glad.
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
Yeah. That's right, too.
Twelve. Cross side.
You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
Game's over, Eddie.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.
With them?
We move.  Place to place.
Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive.
You're not them.
We don't know that --
Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
Stay alive.
Yes.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
Yes.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
Good night.
You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
No.
Yes.
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
Hide the car.
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
The back door was open.
Oh?
They're from out of state.  Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.
You don't understand. You have to leave Washington.
Connie, don't hang up.
He's not going to listen to me.
He's a good man.
Did it work?
Punched the President? Oh my god.
My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
Think nothing of it, Spanky.
All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there.
And the good news is you won't charge me.
Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.
Dad, don't start.
Can't this thing go any faster?
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
He wasn't the President then.
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.
Just getting a feel for her.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
She should be shortly.
The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
ETA with target; four minutes.
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
And our troops here?
That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
It had been deemed classified.
No Sir. Definitely not.
You know me...
Sorry for what?
I'm a dancer.
Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
I didn't even see them fire!
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
We should leave too.
Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
But, Mr. President...
Above American soil?
Here... now.
Many worlds...
I'm going after Dad.
Arghhh! Oh!
What?
It's war.
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
How dare he?!
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
Yes?
Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
Are you sure?
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
Mine, too.
So it did.
Then wait -- count to twenty.
He was actually there? You saw him?
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
Look, can we discuss this later?
So did I.
All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
What?
All right Dad -- tell me.
Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.
What did you find, Dad?
Ready.
Come on -- come on!
But, Indy --
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
My name is Kazim.
No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.
Miss Scott panicked?
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!
Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
Okay, Shorty.
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."
Read you loud and clear, Indy!
What?
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
What evil?
He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.
Their children?
It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
A SNAKE!!
Keep stroking it!
I know the feeling...
I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
He'll be okay. He's a good kid.
Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub.
No -- real food.
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!
You've got to go to sleep now.
Yes, they believe you.
There's got to be another way out.
And they don't even know what it really is.
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
What's going on?
Yes?
I just got here.
What street?
Yeah?
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
What are you doing in my head, Al?
Me? What'd I do?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Then I'm crazy.
Who was that? Somebody out there?
Why not?
Then what are you stopping for?
Can't see a Goddamn thi..
I don't know. I don't want to find out.
You gotta help.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
With Authority!
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
Don't know.
Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
Why not?
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
The beach.
What is it?
You eat it.
Where are you going? Wait!
Try another language.
To the hotel. To register.
Well you did it today.
That place. By the window.
What glasses.
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
I don't know what's going on.
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
Oh come on.
Joe! It's 56 hours!
I don't know!
Is that all?
What do I do?
A hard left. A hard left.
Never mind, just say it.
No. You can't trust her.
Probably.
While he makes the run.
And Dieter?
I can't handle that thing.
...Shit! It's just money.
What exactly?
Losing power. The laser drained it.
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
Looks like you can have all you want.
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
Yeah, sure.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
It'll remind me of you.
Don't give her your name.
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
They took the tapes.
We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with them?
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
We insist.
You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
And how do you service foreigners.
Who...are you?
Oh....Sure.
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
The little man in my...  ...head...
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
Just give me the keys.
Yessir...very good sir.
Nothing.
I said...I didn't say..anything!
I didn't say anything.
Like there's someone else here.
...Rene.
Why?
You talk to yourself.
What do you mean?
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
No.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
Food doesn't agree with me.
Why?
I'm just on vacation.
What is it?
Get your things.
Oh sure.
It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
We figure out if it's in here.
I asked him.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
Can you?
It was my choice.
Why did you, then?
You're gonna laugh.
Her?
But you did it. It was you.
I know a nice island.
Why not?
Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
Yes.
So we better get started.
She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
That remote control thing?
Yes, baby?
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
What? Forget it.
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
No, I'm not...
Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
Hey, Lowell.
Okay. 
No, no, we're fine...
"Mike?"
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
How are you, Jim?
Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
Don't you have to be at the office?
That's my stuff from the office...
No, thank you.
I'm doing an interview.
Where should I wash them?
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
I can't... I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow.
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
...you fucked me!
I'll call you then.
Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
Alright. What did you think?
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
Everything interests me.
Did work.
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
Good. I want to talk to you.
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
It's obvious, isn't it?
You charge by the hour?
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
I heard.
You mean... since this morning?
Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.
What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...!
What kind of shit is this? I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team... okay?
ABC...?
And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
What?
I can't say that!
She's okay.
Liane has filed for divorce...
A delivery device for nicotine.
You're gonna get your fix...
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
It acts as a drug on the body?
There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
Howard!
Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
You want Botox?
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
Got any symptoms?
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
It's your move, Miles.
Yes?
So, that's good, right?
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.
Ruth Rabino.
I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
I said yes.
I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
Oh boy. If he only knew.
But you don't agree?
You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
So I hear. Is that all?
Miles. Miles. Miles.
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
Miles?
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
Huh?
Do you want me to sleep on it?
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
Hello Marylin.
I love you. I want to have your baby.
What do you want?
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
Hello Miles.
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.
Of Massey Myerson?
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
Excuse me?
When you have a moment.
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
Rex, please.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
I don't know. I can assume...
Well -- is that possible?
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
What are they?
HA!
She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
What...?
Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.
Who's "Patty."
Maybe next time.
Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sir—she sent me for a drink.  Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.
"I found a million dollar baby—"
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
You're a peculiar chap.
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to—
She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every day—whether it's coming to her or not.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
Oh, no.
No.
I don't know.
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
Is that his name?
I suppose so.
Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to—  —as long as I can get her back. 
She hasn't had a thing yesterday—or today.
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one—
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
Yes, sir.
Any others?
What do they say?
But it's King Westley on the phone.
Oh—the papers—
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
You must have me confused with—
I didn't ask for your advice. 
Beat it! 
That's none of your business.
Are you talking to me!
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
Smart aleck!
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You—you had it pressed.
Hurry up and get dressed.
Egg. One egg—doughnuts—black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
My uncle—Mother's brother—had four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
You're prejudiced.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
know—but—
What?
What if nobody stops for us?
Clever.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
Why not? I'm hungry.
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself.  Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you.  Oh, Peter—
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Do you know?
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of it—the groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on, King. You're lagging. 
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
When does the bus leave?
Thank you.
Husband?
Isn't he here?
Yes?
What time is it?
Yeah!
Yes.
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
Collect?
Said he was gonna stay a week.
What's on your mind?
Why—no—
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.
Orange, New Jersey.
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
The anonymous kind, Chief.
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing.  It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue.  There's no chain of evidence, Bill.  And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository?  One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - "a patsy".  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, "O.H. Lee" to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?
To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.
Yeah.
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
I did.
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
Dave?
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
Why Galveston?
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
I had the cause of death.
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
Hi, Freckle Face.
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
No, you don't!
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
Goddamn!  They put Oswald together from Day One!  Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board.  Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems.  You got the word "microdots" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination.  Does the real Oswald know he's been put together?  Who knows.  It doesn't matter, does it?  He's a low level spy, he doesn't know who he really works for...
This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
A Perry Russo?
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
Tough day.
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
It's going to get worse, honey.
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
Well... yeah.
I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63.
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
What are you driving at, boss?
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job.  Lou, come alive.  These things are not adding up.
Between six and seven seconds.
You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
More than ten years.
If you buy what you read in the paper.
Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when...
She's the best damn witness we have!
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
Germany.
I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
Yes.
Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
Oh, that's not a problem.
I know. That's why I went.
Who was there for your ass?
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
That's not what they're tellin' me.
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
She almost sounds scared.
She wants to go back to work.
Sure.
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away.  Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?
While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
Fine.
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
I am, as a matter of fact.
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
Shit.
Sure.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
Ordell pick up his bond?
I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
How many trips did you make?
It looks nice.
Uh-huh.
How'd you find that out?
He called you?
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
How was it?
I don't care.
They seem to like the idea.
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
Right around here, in the food court.
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.
I know.
You'll get over that.
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
Not every day?
You planted that shit on me.
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
Can I smoke?
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
What are you doing?
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
Was she there?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
Buy ya a beer?
Keep it between us girls?
Hi, Melanie.
Yeah, do you like it?
Do you got something for me?
They asked.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
Baby, I didn't --
I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
I told them.
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
A woman.
But you don't?
What'd you care?
What the hell you talkin' bout?
How do you know she did that?
Where you gonna be during all this?
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
Susanville.
Bank robbery.
It's a diet thing?
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
No.
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
Who's arm is that?
Must of made quite an impression.
That sounds like a problem.
Sure.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
No.
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
What's your cost?
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
I dunno.
The moon -- I dunno
You're outside?
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
Not now, pick me up.
Uh-huh.
It's in there.
Maybe the Feds got it.
Watcha gonna see?
Gonna have to put up cash.
Cost you a thousand for the bond.
They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
Yes.
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
Beaumont worked for you.
Was she?
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
Git your ass in here.
Winston found you.
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
Have her bring the money here.
I know where to turn.
It's Beaumont.
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
What are you then?
You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.
Oh God!
Stop!!!!
Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
That's right. We did.
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
They're not interested, Jake.
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
Ah! Well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they?
Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?
You need ... a doctor.
Used you?
But the paper ...
What else did he say, Jake?
I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
An explosion, just like Paul's.
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
Wiggle your toes.
I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
It's good to see you.
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
Jacob Singer.
Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
No. Don't move me.
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
I didn't want to wake you.
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
I don't let anybody call me that.
A good lay.
The best.
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
Lemme see.
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
Why you left.
Not to me.
What's wrong?
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Where?
Where's Della? Bring her here?
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
The numbers stop at 107.
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
Coming here?
That's your decision.
You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
He did? When?
Why didn't you call me?
Jezzie?
Let go!
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
I'm not upset.
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
Shows how much you knew.
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
Never?
I don't know.
Pleasant dreams.
I no from around here.
Push 'em back.
You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Call my chiropractor.
Where am I?
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
That's a lie. My family was here.
Last night! They were as real as you are!
Paul Gruneger!
A long time.
Nothin' much.
I need to see you.
I work in a bakery.
Count 'em on one hand.
Nope.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
Died?
Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
Pour it in.
Pause play.
We're not leaving Crutch!
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
No.
THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
Thorgan, pull us in.
He....He...
Oh man, what the hell happened?
Negative.
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
I'm pulling, damnit!
What if we don't?
So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
You?
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
I think I had some when I was eight.
I think so, why?
Old woman?
She broke my fucking nose!
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
Just come on, I've got an idea.
Well, do something!
NO!
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
Kay-em 14.
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
Are there any other shuttles?
A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
We're missing two of the kids!
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
Nanotechnology.
JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
But...I...400 years?
My boat's neat, dad!
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
You got it.
You got it.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...
Have to pump her steady, s'all.
Full throttle! To port!
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
No. Home here.
You going to be all right?
Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
What kind of a shark did you say it was?
I was acting in the town's best interests...
What stinks so bad?
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
Chum?
Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
That means closing the beaches.
Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct.  I know sharks.
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
Get out of there – take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer.
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
Twenty years.
I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
You're leaving?
This is Quint, Missus.
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
Transplants?
Anti-Shark cage.
Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.
The shaft is giving.
Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
Or something.
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Oh, hey Vijay.
Yup.
Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
Excuse me?
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
You don't know anything about me!
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
Oh.
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
No, more commercial stuff.
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
You're something else.
Why? What the big deal?
Why?
Is Vanessa here?
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
You're gonna like this, I promise.
What's the matter?
Really? Fingernails?
Oh really?
Nothing...
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
Either I just pissed my pants or...
I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
Dude, I'm pregnant.
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
I'm staying pregnant, Le.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
What?
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
...I said, I like your hair.
So you don't do any of those things.
No it is not!
That's not true!
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
Vernon, Florida.
Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.
How much do I owe you?
Dahlia, no.
Thank god!
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
Why?
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
You sure been acting like you were...  ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
Why, what did he do?
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
What are you going to do?
Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
No.
No, never. Excuse me.
Siesta.
Everybody just shut up!
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.
You fucked it?
How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
How?
Right.
What do you mean?
What for? That guys a dick.
You think he's got any herb?
He lives on 76th?
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
Right.
Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
Yep.
Yeah me too nigga.
No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
Darcy?
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
What are you talking about?
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
Yeah.
Yeah probably.
You are?
Right now?
Is it cold?
Trust me. Don't be nervous.
But I'm scared Telly.
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
15.
Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
Everything is wrong.
Hell yeah, they don't know.
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh.
Yep.
Have you ever swallowed it before?
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
When are you gonna be back?
I don't know, eight or nine.
Yeah.
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
What are you saying?
You are!  I don't like you.
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
No.
Let's see how much he wants to play.
You think you're going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
I wouldn't know.
What do you want?
No, I need the original note.
I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
Run it down.
I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
Where is she?
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
Not really.
You like to brag, don't you?
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
No!  Wait!!
They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down.  Put it down, David.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
He already did once.
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
Boys.
Of course.
Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
Thanks, David.
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
Yes.  Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?
The most logical choice.
Ten days ago.
Only in passing.  To say hello to.
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
We've already met.  Haven't we... Doctor.
"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
It doesn't make sense.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
That's all he needs.  He's making the moves.  It's an opening.  I just can't remember the name.  Okay, it's a game.  He's starting it, so he moves first.  He's white.  e2-e4.
When I was very young.
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
Getting too hot in here for you?
Another kind of game?
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
I'm sorry.
And you?
Then show me who you are.
Call room service.
How could you think that, Kathy?  How could you even consider it?
Can I come in?
But I do.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
He didn't tell you either.
Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
You must move away from the Center.
I don't know how.
All directions are the same here.
Yes.
In the old books. It's called a glaive.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
You won't have to.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
The Fortress moves?
Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.
There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
Let us wish him peace.
Where the spiral begins.
I chose the wrong passage.
No! You cannot know that!
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
He saved our lives.
Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
How did you know I had sons?
Hah! You don't know me, boy.
I am Quell.
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
No.
Would you desert your friends?
Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
You had better manners as a pig.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
Hush!
Look at its insides.
He will not come. You will be my queen.
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
I knew.
That I am, my lady.
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
Many have perished in that maze.
She has the power to kill.
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
It's a hundred leagues from here.
Ynyr!
We had no children.
Of what?
Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
Yeah... How do you know it?
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
No.
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
Yeah.
Yes.
Do you need money?
I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu.  That's why you can't have a bank account!
What, for example?
What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
Whoever.
You were scared, weren't you?
Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
...17.
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
A little...
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
I love you so much, Leon.
Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it?
I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel it would go the wrong way.
Yes.
...Yes.
Nothing, for the moment.
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
Fine...
Huh? That's smart!
Huh, that's good!
Huh?
Messina.
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
Where?
I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
How serious is it?
I'll kill you!
It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
There was no card.
It's just a regular day.
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
You're talking to me?
Then why?
Show me.
You like to take walks?
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
Not our problem.
Not our problem.
This guy's not a murderer.
You tell stories?
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
Making the grand total?
By car right?
Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
Why know?
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
I was thinking you could open another store with investors.  I'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now.
What, come on?
Don't do this.
It's mine to risk.
No more words.  Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words.
Where am I?
Steph.
You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.
Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
No, I can't have dinner with you.
Is that really what you want to ask me?
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
What?
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
Oh, and what did you do?
We?
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
Can we just ignore it?
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
Yes... I guess I knew that.
Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale.
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.
Go to hell.
Get up.
You're fired. I have new representation.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
No, she'd stashed it by then.
No. I was in the shower.
Thank you.
What?
-- uh --
I don't know.
No!
No.
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
Relation?
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
Yes, you are.
You think?
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
Thank you. I love you, too.
Your scrunchie?
Power yoga?
Did she do that to you, too?
I wasn't gonna --
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
Why not?
And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it?  See you tomorrow!
Your what?
There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
So are you!
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --
What, like it's that hard?
Do anything exciting?
Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
Yes.
Why do you say that?
I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
Grotesque... monstrous...
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
I am afraid of nothing.
Do it now!
From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
I'm in no mood for dancing.
Faerie ring?
What does she want from me?
Don't you care about what's happened?
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
And who might that be?
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
It would appear so.
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
Blackheart?
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
That would be Devil's Needle.  Last landmark I know in these woods.
Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.
Stoutly spoke, lad.  These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.
Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.
Willful creature, that one...
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
Nay.  This time we strike first!
And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
Can you save her?
Mean you to seek him out below?
Patience, lad.
He'll not escape me.
Where?
That's it then... the ring!
I may have said perhaps...
All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
My own father...
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
And I... love you...
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
Pinching me!
His feet shall never cross my lips.
Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue.
No fear of that now.
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
Heading north still?
I think she's about to foal.
It's done... we'll never catch him.
Oh, but I have.
May God protect you.
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
You've been inside?
He was there and then he wasn't!
Sam!
Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
I guess it depends on what you give up on.
I love red!  That's my favorite color!
You'd better call and cancel.
I couldn't sleep last night.
Has he eaten anything at all?
Who are all these people?
What's that?
I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?
Where to?
No thanks.
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
Not if what he left me was real.
Floating to Catalina.
He's got a standing invitation.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
It could have been a squirt gun.
We've known each other since grade school.
George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
And if I enclosed it?
how much weight have you lost?
I'm not.
From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
For everything.
Thank you.
She's out with a friend.
I'm sorry.
Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
Why would you be there?
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
No I'm not!
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
It'll be fine.
Hey...hey!
I don't know.
I don't know.
I might have a solution.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
To hide a black eye.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
Good for you.
I can die trying.
I haven't been touched in years.
We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
She's a little sad, is all.
Money?
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
Where will you live?
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
Let's go.
He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it.
Well, for later then.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
Sam's favorite.
What have you been before today?
I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
I can hire workers to help me.
What did I say?
You bit my finger.
I didn't think you'd come today.
It's not my back that's killing me.
Does Alyssa know?
She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen.  I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing.  She like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
I could use the money.
His father is a man.
Sooner than the Fall.
What?
What are you doing home?
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
I never asked for more.
Take it off.
Hey.
I didn't go in your room.
And the baby?
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
Take care of me?
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
I know it begins with a "C"...
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
A loan officer?
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
There is no Boom-Boom Room.
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
So you made a generous contribution.
He even got my daddy's watch.
We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
He's dead.
Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
He does it all by himself.
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here.
Claude.
Yeah.
You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
Him?
Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
Make 'em throw strikes.
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.
That's the way it is.
Goodnight, Ray.
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
I said you're soft.
He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
You didn't get ketchup?
Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
I'm sorry, he's on medication...
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
You killed Santa Claus?
He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town.
What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
Are you offering me a bribe?
You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.
That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
Something like that, yes.
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
You found him.
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
You shouldn't have come here.
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
Absolutely not.
Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
You mother...
Sure, why not?
You want a queen? Got one right here.
Show him Central Park.
It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
You're already there...
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
No.
Put it in your mouth.
Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
Release the evil?
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
I think you're looking at him.
He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
You did it for Namath.
Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
That's a pretty brassiere.
Beast.
I know, your wickedness.
It's Stanley, sir.
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
That way.
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
You keep a bat under your seat?
Why are you laughing?
Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
What was that?
What are you doing?
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
East Rutherford.
That was Cassius!
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
I don't know.
Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
See something you like, my man?
All right -- what are you?
Where do you send them?
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU!
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
I'm fine...  See you...
It has nothing to do with you.
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
I'm Mary 2.
Please... No.
He was killed.
No.
I thought I had to do something.
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
K.
And I never heard of Sanctuary.
What do you need?
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
But what is this -- why?
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
They won't listen.
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
I doubt it.
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
What's that?
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
Gracious... no.
Dead... they're dead... and buried.
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
No, no, no
Not yet.
Yes...
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.  Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
I don't think so.
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
No, I'm okay.
They're comin' with us.
What is?
No. Fred hates them.
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
His or ours?
You know what I think?
Yeah, I remember.
Over there.
Me, too.
Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
It's me...
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
We should stop seeing each other.
He works for Mr. Eddy.
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
Yeah.
Pete... Don't...
Okay...
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Oh, yeah?... What else?
Alice, I...
Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
Sure.
Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever".
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
The wife killer?
No.
Out in back.
Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
Coming up.
Nothin'.
Who was the man?
He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
Not even close.
FUCKIN' "A".
My... My head.
What do you mean? You're where right now?
Alice who?
What night?
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
All right!
Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
Pornos?
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
What?
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
You know who it is.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
I don't want to talk about it...
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
Come on.
Thank you.
Fossils.
A paleontologist.
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
Please don't call me Lovey.
Just call me Barney.
Okay, Lovey.
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
All right.
Nothing. Why?
When are you going to start?
How do you do?
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?
The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
Pardon me—
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
Yes.
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as—
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
Mine?
Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
You?
Do try to sleep, Bob.
I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.
It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
Let me go, Bob!
All right. Sorry, George.
Porters?
I don't see that there's anything to say.
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
She's going with me.
Yes, everything!
There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
What if he refuses?
In for what?
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
Oh, you mean my pigeons.
That was easy. I read your books.
I saw a man whose life was empty.
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
I wonder.
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
I was just going to.
How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
All right, I'll be there.
It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
And Goodwill Toward Man?
I gotta be honest about something.
And if I say yes?
His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
No. But You'll get used to it.    Welcome to the Men in Black.
Actually, sir--
Yup.  Sure is.
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
Sir--
Why?  What are you gonna do?
I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
Let's check am out.
It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
Get back in the car!
The Pentagon.
Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
Do his job.
Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
Actually, yeah--
Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
The what?
Fine.  Good.
Dee?  What are you doing here?
Oh shit!
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
Is it now?
Please --
What is it?
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
Because I found out about her...
Anne Lively...
I know... I do, too...
The nano... what?
-- go blind.  I know.
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
Uh-huh...
Hang on, Lamar --
I understand.  What's the other thing?
I go running down there.
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
That was easy.
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
Yes, it is.
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
You gonna tell on me?
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
I need your help.
Rufus.  She's a precog.
That's right.
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
So?
I guess that's all of it.
That's great.
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
Once I even told him I loved him.
Good-bye, Dad...
I'm your son.  I'm you.
He's alive?
NO!
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
I'm a little dizzy...
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
And how did Lamar become involved?
Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
The safest place of all.
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
My God...
What?
Wait, just a second...
Yes.
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
People have gotten the message.  Gum?
I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
Two?
I don't know, why?
Knott!
You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder...
Who?
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
No thank you.
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
See you later.
Holy shit.
He's alright.
Bullshit.
No more.
She's, uh, sleeping.
He's not doing it.
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
There's no touching.
I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
You driving her?
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
No.
Where's Ricky.
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
Then what are you saying?
Ruiz knows about this?
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
Good morning.
I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?
Ricky's taken care of.
Listen, man, we really gotta...
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
He's not here.
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
Shhh...
We don't need guns.
What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
Fuck him.
What are we delivering?
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
It's not even yours.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
This paint sucks. The white shows through.
To keep?
What's the movie?
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
Shhh... Hello, room service?
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
What did I 'get?'
I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
Like I said, I don't know.
You too?
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
You want us strapped, don't you?
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
What do you have left?
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
I don't want to take any more chances.
You're not getting a gun.
You want your surprise?
The line's over there.
What?
Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
S'up.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
Ugh...
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
The videos.
Yes.
I know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. What the fuck you think this shit is? '21 Jump Street?'  Cool out, they're coming back. Just throw up your screw face and don't speak unless spoken to.
Why? What I say bad?
You really in trouble?
A little Charlie, perhaps.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
You'll love it.
Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
No. What is it?
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
We're square.
Thanks.
Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
And where do we bring it?
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
So tell me how it is.
So, you must be the Red Dragon.
A rose by any other name would --
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
Who's up for a night on the town.
He had it coming.
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
I done told the man what he could do with his train.
Nnnnnnn!
Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
You know it.
Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
That's a fact. What you do, boy?
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
I ain't said I'm ashamed.
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
Read it and keep on reading.
Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.
No. That's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?
I sure met some.
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
Mr. X, I won't make you out a liar.
And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
She ate.
If you want to tell me.
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
What?
I can handle it.
What have you set your mind to?
Yes.
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
The talk is everywhere!
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
Entirely.
Allah Akbar.
What?
The sentences to run concurrently.
I know where you're going.
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
Your control over your children, therefore --
500.
Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation.
And don't come back.
Me?
Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later.
Shorty, this is Laura.
Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
Might be all right.
You heard the Sergeant. Outside.
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
I show, you give me the information?
[We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that...]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[Where do I find him?]
[I believe you.]
[How do I recognize him.]
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
Nothing wrong.
Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
I said the plan was right here.
Pinta...
I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
Different door. Not far from here.
If they like me.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
I'm not crying.
How do you think he got out?
It's better to be free, right?
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
You need to practice.
I don't understand.
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
I know you're not.
The gunshot holds no fear.
Could I stop you?
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
Planned what?
Then don't come.
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
This is Mr. Creasy.
Our daughter.
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
Hmm?
[Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
Two tourists who never went home.
What was she to Creasy then?
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
Which one was that?
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
It's her baby too, you know.
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
Catherine, don't make an opera outta this. The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. You are an old goat, and she has an Italian temper. She is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down.
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
Benjamin Franklin High School.
Yes, I know.
I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on...
Yes, I know.
Nothing.
I'll wait for your call.
Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
That's the one.
About eight o'clock.
Sure, what?
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
You gotta good heart.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
I say, why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with tomatoes.
Tomatoes.
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
You gonna get married.
Sure.
I don't know. I don't think so.
Waddaya read there, Joe?
Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
Hello, Thomas.
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
That's all right, that's all right...
Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock.
I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
No.  Or why you should.
Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
What the hell's going on here?
Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.
I don't drink intoxicants.
Same general idea.
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
And get ourselves another touchdown to win.  I wish to hell we knew what they were plotting.
What's there to do? You found the sliver.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
He can't take much more time on the table.
We been had.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry? He creates more work than he gets done.
Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?
A native is someone who is born in a particular place.
Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
People will talk.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
No, no, that one.
So let's haul ass, Sergeant.
Radar!
We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
Something else we have in common.
It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.
I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
Why would he do that?
Second pint.
What do you want with those two medical officers?
Let's get his clothes off quick.
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
You guys got any black capsules?
That. It's out of the act.
Nope, we're assigned heah.
That's all the commitment you're offering me?  Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?
You mean who hit who?
I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
I used to throw the javelin.
They can't do that to me!
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
Um-hum.
Oh, crabby guy, huh?
Against what?
Who?
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
Hello.
No, thank you.
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Look, John—what we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a—
Thirty dollars.
Oh, I'm sure I can.
How do you do.
And, Miss Mitchell—I think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
Go ahead, open it, open it.
A third party?
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the house—and then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and—
The Websters.
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
There is no letter.
There is no letter. I made it up.
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
So?
Well, you're catching on.
Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
I got it all ready. Here.
Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
No, no, no. Now that's too much!
That's fine, honey. Now, get out!
Yeah, a little.
Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
Sure. Mostly often.
I know why you're hangin' around—you're stuck on a girl—that's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!
John Doe Club?
Yeah, you bet!
Yeah. It certainly is.
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
Shut up! If you weren't drunk I'd—
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.  Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different types of hoboes appear—and in each instance ANN shakes her head, negatively.
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
Say, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here.
No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers.
Nineteen!
How?
Feller runs the Chronicle .  Here's the speech you make—and it's all written out for you.
No, sir.
Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.
Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
Is there a problem?
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
Solis said to keep you clear of this.
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
Yeah.
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
I don't really like to drink.
Explain how that works.
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
Every couple of months, huh?
Yes.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
I do.
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
To run late!
Occasionally you lose.
Damnit!
Pull up alongside.
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
You worship yourself.
Greg.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
Can I come in?
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
It's all over, babe, it's all over.
Scottie...
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
Depends. What's up?
Your concern is heartwarming.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
Who's running it!
-- Two million people lost in the digital night.  What do they seek?
True.
To live forever.
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
No...
That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.
Yes.
Only up there in the dream they called life.
Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
What about the customers with reservations?
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  It's not worth it.
That's right.
The truth.
Then where is she?
Cleaning up a mess.
No.
No.
Who are you?!
I know.
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
There?
Destination?
Uplink selected.
Wait a second...  What time is it?
How can we reach Phaedos?
Now tell me... what do you see?
Stylin'!
I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
... Let's take a look over there.
WHITE TIGER!
What does that mean?!
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
Where did it originate?
I think so.
This guy is messing with the wrong teenagers!
Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!
Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
A stellar idea, Skull.
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
Did I say anything?
Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
GO IVAN!!
What do you mean "basically"?
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
Charlie Luciano.
I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
What's that divided four ways?
From your mouth ta God's ear.
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
How's Bugsy doin'?
Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
No. I'm here with you.
I needed to see you again.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
It always is.
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
So what is the problem?
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
Who?
They don't give a shit about us!
Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
Never threaten me, Boss.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
He's trying to make it.
So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
I know about you.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
But that's an hour's drive.
The kid just called me stupid.
Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?
I must know more of you, my son.
And the Jews?
No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.
We were overdue to get hit.
We can operate around these guys.
Shuddup.
Jesus.
Fuck 'em.
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
Guess I'm just lucky.
Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world, but that's the way it is.
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
Kinda early for Christmas, Bugs.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
Uhh - martini?
Stu Miley.
Sad commentary, huh?
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
Thank me next time you see me.
I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
I don't think so.
Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
How am I gonna get past the guards?
Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
I don't <u>know</u>.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
I just need to use the phone, lady.
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
Aaron?
Goodbye, sweetheart.
... Manly?
So, you come here all by yourself?
... Oh ...
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
Forty-five all total.
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Thanks very much, sonny--
Let's send out a pigeon!
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--! 
Yeah. What about the second act?
"There's more light here," he says--
Good idea. When?
Tonight?
Okay--I mean--
What is it?
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
Than what?
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
The porter's got them. They're coming.
For one week!
"Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
Nonsense, Jeff.
Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
Well--I'll go to Halifax!
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
J-Jefferson Smith.
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
I know--but you--you're going to help.
Right.
Why?
The Steering Committee.
*This* is.
I said--shall we get started *now* or--
I want to make that come to life-- yes, and lighted up like that, too-- for every boy in the land. Boys forget what their country means--just reading "land of the free" in history books. And they get to be men--and forget even more. Liberty is too precious to get buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men ought to hold it up in front of them--every day of their lives and say: "I am free--to think--to speak. My ancestors couldn't. I can. My children will."
He did?
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
Why?
No!
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
No--
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
Must have been tickled pink.
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
Saunders--
I'm not.
I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked.
Wait--
Oh--Saunders--
To a hard night's work, son. Come on! 
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
Then you *did* say it.
Goodnight, Senator--
Splendid.
And how's your bill, Senator?
Well--I--
The Senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.
Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
He did it.
--in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
Jim, you don't have to--
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
No--I--I'll take a walk-- 
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
Who are you?
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
No, no children.
Thank you very much.
Would you like to go for a walk?
No! I resigned last week!
Yes!
NO!!
What's that got to do with it?
Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
Oh, I don't mind.
I enjoy it.
What did they say?
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
Nothing—
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
A girl?
No. It's nothing.
I can't write it, Mabel! I don't know what's the matter with me.
What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
Hello.
What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have—
With pay!
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
Shhh!
John—
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get—
Yes, sir.
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
Let me go! I wanna see him!
This is outrageous!
See you later, kid.
I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
All right.
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to—
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
Who - me? No.
No, thank you.
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
Oh, they insisted on following me.
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
Uh-huh.
Well, thanks, I - uh—  How do you do? What is your name?
What kind of wife did you say she was?
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.  You know, we've got letters.
Mr. Morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
I'm a writer myself, you know.
I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
Fun?  Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  Boy! Boy! My headpiece!
I don't know.
Of course they're going to stay.  She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top?  Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.
Now you keep out of this!
Christian Svenson.
South Dakota north.
Thank you so much. Good night.
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
I just wanted to make sure.
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
What two policemen?
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
Yes, sir.
Me more than most.
Good kids.
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
What's that?
No, not really.
Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! Are we listening to Lionel now?
No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
I don't want to hear any more today.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
What?!
A little.
My patient had to leave early.
I think it's like... inquisitive.
Oh, I don't know...
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
Doc.  Ainge...
It's a pretty piece of land.
-- Go on!
Sure I can, Lionel.
Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
Sure.
You're good.
Mumford... like the town?
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
Is that like a party trick?
Disgusting.
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
That's... good?
Of course.
What was that?
I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
It's called pro bono.
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
That's not quite what I said --
What happened today?
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
Nah... scotch.
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
This is exactly what I wanted.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
Everybody has a story, Skip.
You were messed up, man.
Really?
Wow.
What?
You're not going to kill us?
Why do you like to fight so much?
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
What friend? You're my only friend.
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
You shall see.
What does he want the book for?
Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
Water turning to blood.
I would never!
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
What are you doing here?
Broad?!
I just decked your brother
No, I mean --
What did you find? What did you see?
Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
We're about to be shown the way.
Preparation for what?
And what is that?
Because that's my name.
Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
Right now, I only wish to join them.
I was mistaken.
Picked his pocket, actually.
Shut-up and get me off of here!
Read the inscription on the cover!
Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
Be nice. That thing saved my life.
That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
And then he'll be coming after Evy.
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
Head hunting.
One last tweak.
I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.
I got it.
Really?
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
Me.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Not tonight. 
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
Roy.
It's home.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
Yes.
Good or evil, what's the difference?
When are you going to take off that mask?
My heart died a long time ago.
He is in love. His anger is gone.
We had an off night, that's all.
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
Because that's what it is.
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
Wait!... Look!
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
Yes.
Anybody got any?
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
Mother... it's not what you think!
Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
Shut up.
Great timing!
Through there!
I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
Proceed.
Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
What forces do you have at your disposal?
Where are they?
Fair enough.
The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
No, sir, none at all.
Thank you, sir.
Yes, I am.
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
I'll have the fire built up.
Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
Lisette La Croix.
Promises mean nothing.
Open the door.  It's me.
I know what you're doing in there.
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
Certainly.
What are you talking about?
Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
Yes, I wrote it.
About Hippolyte Charles.
God help me -- yes.
Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me.
Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me.  It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
Don't move me.
Yes you did.
Not me.
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
Okay, plan B.
Fuuuuuuck -- U!
No.
Me too.
What about me?
What are you doing here?
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
Hurry up; today is Fri-day!  And we gotta hit the high-way!
I'll remember.
Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
Ever since my momma died the bills are always late.
I know.
Let it go!
Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
Where's Craig?
Why did he go in the house?
Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday.
I don't know.
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
That ain't gonna work.
What?
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
I don't know.
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
Okay.  Bye, Craig.
Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
San Diego.
Sorry.
Of course.  I wish everything were that easy.
My security people are right next door.
No.
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
Same to you.
Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.
What's your point?
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
You fucked up.
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
That's right. That gives you...
You know what I'm gonna do.
Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
No! You can't! They're in on it.
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
I'm just an accountant.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
Oh, man...
What are you going to do?
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all.
Why?
Shut up.
Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
I kill her anyway.
Yeah.
What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Yes, Dad.
Not even her?
I will guard Pearl with my life...
When'll the skiff be ready?
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
She went.
But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
A man of the Cloth?
Come on!
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
Mister Powell!
What!
There! What's so hard about that!
'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
Hm?
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
Hush, Pearl. Come on.
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
She talks to herself.
Up river.
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
No. No.
Yonder.
What secret shall I tell?
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
Because John said I mustn't.
Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.
Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
She took them kids with her?
Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
Didn't you hear me, boy?
Them kids!
Not this time! It was just one youngin -- a little boy babe. And do you know who he was, children?
When did I ever?
Now who was this?
Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
Jesus.
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
Yeah.
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
You do?
My dream.
Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
Krueger.
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
It wasn't that serious...
Right home after. See you.
I won't.
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
So he's alive?
You were screaming like crazy.
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...
Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
An omelet.
I have nothing to hide.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
Evening gown?
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
Or it might be the firing squad!
That's right.
I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination.  In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!
Right now it's on the balcony.
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
And they might believe her in Moscow.
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
You didn't get legal advice?
With two f's, if you please.
We have opened a restaurant...
Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
Good evening, Monsieur.
Eight forty-two, sir.
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
Are they indeed? Thank you.
General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
What is it, my boy?
Oh, Leon, you are so good.
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
No, no.
Two thousand francs.
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?
Yes, Comrade.
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
Well, we're back home.
Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
Yes. It is unfortunate.
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
You're going to force us... huh?
Why should I take a chance?
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
How long does it take a man to land?
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
That's a strange angle.
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
Ni-notchka.
The bayonet? Did you really?
Wounded? How?
Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
It's twelve o'clock.
I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
You know I want to...
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
Why?
Why?
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
Yes.
Yes.
I promise... I swear.
Ninotchka, I love you.
It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!
And General Savitzky.
Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
No speech?
Yes... a little white house.
No! No!
No, no music.
Who cried that one?
It is their wish.
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
Oh, yes.
A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
Yes.
I'm afraid that's what it is.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
Madame, if you...
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
No.
May I ask what has happened?
Yes... leaving immediately.
I don't understand.
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
Raw carrots and beets.
Where is it?
How do you do, my friend.
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
Son of a bitch.
You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
How so?
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
No, sir.
No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
I thought the gloves were off.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
... go on.
Damn right.  And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it?  They wanna believe in the President.
'Night, Al.
A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
Can we get around this, Al?
And if I stay?
It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it.
It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
Silence!
We'll work on it.  I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it.
No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
Yes, sir.  I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?  What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?
He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
I, unlike Senator Kennedy, have a plan to end the war.  But not for peace at any price, but peace with honor!
Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority.
Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ...  Don't forget to be on God's side.
What?
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
Let him finish, Bob.
Sir?
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
Is it my turn?
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
Yes ... It involves some old and forgotten papers.  Things I signed as Vice President.  I want the originals in my office and I don't want copies anywhere else.
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
Yes.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.
Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
He's all business, ain't he, Trini?  Dick, we could've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal.  We brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ...
Here, Tim ... Tim.  I'm as frustrated as you, Henry, but don't you think this one's a Democrat problem.  They started the war; it makes them look bad.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
Yeah ...
Just ... uh ... you know.
Yes, Mr. President.
... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
Sure, I'd like to offer condolences.
Mr. Nixon.
But change always comes slowly.  I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years.  I want an all-volunteer army.  But it's also a question of American credibility, our position in the world ...
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
Well, we could delete it.
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
It's over, Dick.
Not that.  Us.
I want a divorce.
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?
Do you really want this, Dick?
Then I'll be there for you.
I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  And he said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy!  Bomb them where they live." ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV?
Yes, it's been a long time ...
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I don't want to deal with them.  And him.  And you.
Well enough.  You're looking "happy," Nelson.
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
I'm... discouraged.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
Some pretty bad people.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
You sure?
Llewelyn Moss?
I'm hidin' behind you.
So when was he here?
No sir.
You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
I never do.
I can't plan your day.
I don't know. Had dreams.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
...I need to sit down.
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
What makes you say that?
I know something better.
Where does he work?
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
In the truck.  I'll get it.
No me mate.
Well -- where ya goin'?
You know who it is.
Yeah. I know where you're going.
Yes.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
I was just passin' the time.
What time do you close?
Sir?
Well...
Sir?
Everything.
Uh-huh. Double ought.
What room?
I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
Let's just call it square.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
Another additional.
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
I know how he found me.
Yes.
I didn't say braze.
He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
What product.
No I don't have it.
If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
You do, I reckon.
I don't know.
No sir.
I got an overcoat on.
Yes sir. Two tours.
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
I know that...
No, I was just... How you doing?
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
I don't think I am.
Umm... yes. Back home.
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
No, Del.
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
Yes, she is.
What happened when you were twelve?
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
Didn't I?
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.
Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
I ran back in to get the phone.
What's so special about it?
Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll see you when I get home.
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
Make sure it's elevated...
I'll go to the Hospital.
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
He has no heartbeat!
No, that's not, I couldn't...
The one you were telling me about?
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
He has a wife?!
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
You said in L.A., anything goes.
What? Where was he?!
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
No...
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
Beer, please.
You told me how to do it!
Well, why'd you shoot him?
What 'look'?
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
...among others.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
Where? Where is she?
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
A doctor on the show... why?
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
I said I'll think about it.
What the hell's going on?
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
Better.
Sure.
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
Yeah. Why, you know him?
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
Gopher, Everett?
I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the last of George Nelson.
Not that I'm aware.
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
That's good, honey.
Not your...
Well sure, honey, but...
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
But... but...
No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!
It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
I am. Hur you?
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
Yes, Sir.
Yes, sir.
Great.
Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
Nobody. It just came to me.
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you.  Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here!  No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
Well, goodbye.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
I said, come here!
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
Well, I'll be goddamned.
One more minute.
Come on. Let's go dance.
Everything was different.
I haven't made up my mind.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.
Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
Seriously.
No, and I'm not looking for one either.
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
I know who you are and what you want.
I've never had a girl.
Any time, sailor.
What's stopping you?
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
Hey, will you just leave me alone?
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
Your real father?
Why'd he do it?
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
Naw.
A little.
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
No problem, but who's Susan?
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
But it can't wait.
A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
Okay, okay!  Okay.
Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
I know.
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
Shut up and let me think.
Yeah, whatever.
No ball, kid.
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
I said open the door.
Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...
This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
Why?
0150.
Don't.
Feel okay?
Chills?
Give me a break.
Don't though. 
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
"Titanic."
No.
I saw something, I saw...
He won't even know who it was.
Stop it.
I was trying not to tell you...
I'm dizzy and thirsty.
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
What if I keep dropping?
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
Fuck that, we've got company...
You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
Damn straight...  Let's go check out these Paper Panthers.
No more police brutality! WHAT DO WE WANT?
They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
You know it. Stay Black...
Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
Man, fuck you!!!
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?
Can you make a deal with them?
Jesus...
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
So talk...
Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired...
So what's the deal?
What, I don't know how you mean?
Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
Just a kid.
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
Maybe...
Nothing.
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
Not at all.  I'll catch you later.
Where is he?.
Why didn't you tell me?
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
No.
Late summer.
That would be nice, too.
You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.
Do you?
Goodbye.
My pleasure, sir.
That one is a bit more difficult.
Prisoner exchange.
Difficult, sir.  This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
You know how old I am.
And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
I should have killed him when I had the chance?
Granted.  Where are you going?
Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.  I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.
I don't care.  I hate him.
Please.
I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...
Balderdash!
That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
Gabriel.
Long time.
So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
When?
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan.  At least, I used to.
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
Well, I thought it was safe--
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
I know.
No more chocolate chip cookies.
Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
Do you believe that?
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
Is there quicksand?
You're telling me.
Because it's right.
Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
Yes.
What?
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Louis, the house is beautiful.
Did you see his shirt?
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
Yes, I guess I do.
You can't.  I can.
Elizabeth goes free!
And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.
Wait as long as you like.
Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
All right then.
Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
Men!  Are you up for it?
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
I want you to leave.  And never come back.
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
Will -- you can't trust him.
Ceremony?
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
-- but that was not a proper kiss.
I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
She can hold a bit longer.
I know.  That was for the smell.
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
How did he get off the island?
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
I don't think that will be necessary.
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
We need to go!
Good.
Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
My father.  William Turner?
'Bootstrap?'
That's not true.
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
Jack!
It's the right way.
-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
Yes, I have.
... no.
And no lies!
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
Have you found Dr. Bright?
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
Ain't it.
You're not rotting meat.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
Who cares!  We've got to find him! Hurry!
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
If you loved me like I loved you?
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
What did he want?
Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
No!  Well, not those exact words.
Who isn't?
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time.
I guess I should be flattered.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
Daniel, what are you doing here?
Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
What happens?
You're the doctor.
What about it!
The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate.  So what's wrong?
And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
Yeah.  Old times.
I'm glad you came to me for help.
You don't have to say anything, Daniel.  I'm a scientist.  I know what's happening.  I recognize the classic symptoms.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
Yes.
We don't have time to argue, Susan.
I have to!
Oh yes you are!
The question is, are you?
And you have him?
Don't worry, four eyes.
Yes, that is what I was thinking.
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
Yes - isn't it.
Goodbye, Stew—
No? Why not?
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
So, it's obvious, huh?
For what?
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me—
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live—
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
Are you crazy?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.
I see.
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
Oh, hello Mother!
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
Oh, man!
Well, I should say!
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
Yeah?
You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
With me you can always do business.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
I'm not quitting!
No!
Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.
Oh no, sir!
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
I hope you'll be very happy.
Not since you broke into society.
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Yes.
Been where?
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
It'll be ready in a minute.
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
Surely, come right in.
She did—?
It's all right. Bring him in.
Pardon me, madam - but what am I to say to the newspapermen?
Double strength!
Are the cars ready?
I have. Double-strength!
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
Why—
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
All right, Grandma—
Have you seen this? 
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Well, sir, I putter.
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
Thanks.
What do you mean?
Yeah ...  That--and ...
Yes.
What?
No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
Thanks ... I love you.
But I really should get home.
Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
I told you, George. I'm not going.
So.
It's better, Mary Sue.
What?
What's the matter?
Oh, no thanks ...
I'm fine--but thank you.
I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
Thank you very much.
Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
It was accessible to everyone.
Okay--that's enough!
Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
Well, I never had to do it before.
Hello Mr. Simpson.
Green.
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
What happened?
I don't think so.
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
What were you doing in a library?
So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
Well if I don't who will?
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Yes.
Oh ... Right.
Rain.
Sure ...
Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
What department store did they go to?
Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.
Because we don't belong!
My name's David.
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
I'm going to leave now.
Why don't you just take me back without it?
Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
What?
Listen to me!
Yeah ...
Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
Hi.
You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
Hey.
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
And what was this?
So you're coming tonight, right?
She's really cute and she's really nice.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
Did I say that?
No.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna call you back.
I have no idea.
Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
Do you like porno movies?
Are your pants off?
I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I work out. My pussy's shaved. My friends say I'm pretty cute, so....
Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
You're going to work now?
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
I need help.
They don't get opened until eight.
I don't know.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
It's Barry.
No, no. I did.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I see --
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
If you come to Hawaii --
About six months ago. Why?
For what?
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
Ok, bye, bye.
Did you do it?
You're hand is bleeding.
Why?
Yes it is.
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
-- and this is confidential?
What?
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
That's that.
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
My name is Barry Egan and I spoke to you....you called me, you remember?
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
Hey...Lance....can I.....
....yes.....
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
Yeah.
Hi.
Wait a minute --
Please don't do this.
Well....what do you want, then?
This is a bunch of bullshit.
You can't be late though.
Ok.
You don't need to talk all macho, "shake him out, little bad boy." Whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster --
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
Ok.
It's fine.
I'm sorry. You're right.
We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
"Turn you out?"
You'll hate me now, won't you?
It's not even noon --
Enough to discern its tenor.
And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
You always do.
I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
Your wig. Remove your wig.
Was it impotence?
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
A few indiscretions in his youth.
Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one.
And his writing?
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
No. It most certainly was not.
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
Yes?
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
Is it awfully violent?
What's that then?
They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one.
Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
I pray you: be succinct.
What thought is that?
It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
And I in yours.
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
Forgive me, I beg you --
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
I can't
And director.
Do you?
You know that can't happen.
Why is that, Louis?
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
You will not walk out on me
I don't want you to--
We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some of us humans need sleep!
All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
Forget it-
Like a bug.
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
Please don't say this.
Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
And what does he see?
And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TOME -- THIS WAS OUR STORY, REMEMBER? -- YOU AND ME AND GODDAMN EVERYONE ELSE - - REMEMBER THAT?!
So they're Jews. . .
Christ.
What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
Kinda.
Aw, cheer up, George'll probably be running Fox by the morning. Let's get a drink.
Yeah, ain't it swell?
Herman.
Yes.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
Again
They've all seen a rough cut
It's just that my movie is so-
I really think you're
No, we're jake. But listen-
We done?
I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
About what?
Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
It's not done.
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
Here's your glove.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
Give me a chance. Let me look.
You want the title shot?
Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
Yeah, I know.
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
What?
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
You sound bitter.
What do you think of Jake's retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?
At night?
Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
That's all right. He don't mind.
It's OK.
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
Now take your panties off.
Who asked you?
I'm not interested in him.
I never noticed his face.
What did I do?
All I did...
I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
OK. Talk.
Then what?
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
I'm leaving you Jake.
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
He has it. Thank you.
Jefferies?
Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
That's what they call a family problem.
Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.
All right -- you don't believe me.
A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
Oh -- I almost forgot!
Mrs. Thorwald.
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
All the things I hate.
That depends on who "they" were.
This is Doyle, Jeff.
It's me.
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
Who are you?
No.
Well, I only quote from the best.
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
She's all right.
Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
Get back there! He'll see you!
Uh-huh.
I have a feeling we've just begun.
What?
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
Mrs. Doyle?
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
Going on right here. It's a big night.
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
For what?
That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You, of course, remember Miss Torso.
I think it's enchanting.
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
Tell me about it.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Do you think I consider this recreation?
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
Too close.
Your name?
Phone number?
I'm glad they let you out.
Smashed the front door.
Shoot, Jimbo.
Well--
No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
And you can depend on me, son. Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear.
Really, Frank?  When was that?
What's that pounding?
He's home.  I heard the car.
Do you hear from him, son?
No, sir.  I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it.  I guess I'm just no good?
Jim.  What's yours?
Who knows.  Plato?
What's a chickie-run?
I hitched.
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for the summer.
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
Hey!  How 'bout that!
Not lately.
Plato!
Your father!
Get away from me!
No.  At dawn.
Just a guard.
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore!
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
So then you moved?
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Yes, ma'am.
Listen--
I'm not so bad.
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
Neither can I.
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
You don't need to do that.
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
We have to go back!
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
No.  Why?
Gabriel -- !
Gabriel, what are you doing!
Gabriel, let him go --
What are you doing here?!
Don't hurt him...
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
He'll be dead when he does.
That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
Thank you.
Then he shoulda signed his name.
You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
Nick...
Nick --
Nick, what are you --
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
What?
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
Nick, what are you talking about?
I'm almost done.
You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
You said it a million times!
She says a lot of things.
Wish I had a brother like you.
Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here.  Get him back in the rig.
What?
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
What college.
And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
And I worked there. For a year.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
Nick. I been trying to hit you.
I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
'Tis the season, convict.
Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
And where they hide the real money.
I don't know... what you're...
OPEN IT!!!
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.
Acid-chewer.
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
It's a roach, guy --
Fuckin, Zookerman --
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Ain't there yet.
Yeah.
Shoulda written, Rudy...
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
Thought you hate your old man.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
Good for you. Protein.
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
...for Christmas...
She set them up. All of them.
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
But... I had a five...
What? No...
Since when? What the hell is this room?
Yes.
You're coming back to work for us, right?
You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti thinkin "what the fuck." And if Scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. Part of your job is goin' different places - and we got places all over the place.
Who?
Where was she from, Compton?
Was he all pissed off?
Really? Who's your P.O.?
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
Bullshit.
This better not be some Freddy joke.
...What bar?
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
What about?
The Milwaukee Brewers?
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
What do you care?
He don't tip.
You do?
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
Down to my car.
I'm okay.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
I can' take you to a hospital.
I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
A few cops.
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
What do you think?
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
He ain't dead.
I think he's just passed out.
Well, he knows a little about me.
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.
Yeah, those guys too.
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
He's learning his letters.
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
Go on. Tell me more about her.
I'll make the soap myself.
You're not going out to look for them?
So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
All right -- it's said!
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
I haven't got the job yet.
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
A little hot.
I don't want to run short.
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China...
All right, you didn't know.
Nobody asked you to.
Just a thing I was workin' on.
I like it.
Well, say it.
Yes, people make me restless.
There aren't any women here.
Go ahead.
Depends on how good you drive.
I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
That's it then.
Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
Don't you even know your letters?
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
And you've got me all figured out?
Oh, sure.
It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.
Would you die already?!
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
Ray, have you been here all this time?
He's so brave.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
Alright!
It looks like the furnace.
Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
Great!!!
Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Oh.
Thanks, I'll be fine.
It's okay.
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
Yeah, I broke my fall.
Thanks. I made them by hand.
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
Not in a thousand years.
Made you say it!
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
I don't need your help.
Just wait, you'll see.
Alright, let's take a vote...
My child you are the only survivor.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
In about fifteen minutes.
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
You do.
That's right.
Thanks, handyman.
Yours, or the turkeys?
That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate.
What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
Father, come in, please.
How is she?
What?
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
You said you hated him.
If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?
I certainly did not.
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Let me see!
I'm so happy I could shit.
You scared me.
You mean for TV or print?
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly.  See the little birdie? Listen to his call.  Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan!
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
We can be real quiet...
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
Oooohhhh.
Ooohhhh!
You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!
I beg your pardon?
No, I don't.
One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking".
Socially... I'll have a beer.
NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
Marvin A. Pickles.
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
We all have bad nights. 
Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary.
NO! I could never hurt anyone!
Yes... but... I didn't...
No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
Bon Appetit!
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
What's he know?
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
You can?
Can we go there now?
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
Yes, I understand.
Drink.
Yes.
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
She can only use cash.
For the time being, I imagine that must do.
Oh, as beautiful as ever.
Thank you.
No. She asked about the trademark.
But you do believe me?
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -—
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
Why wait?
I won't get lonely.
I don't know.
Devil worshippers!
I have to go —-
And Gregory -- he loves her.
What's wrong, Mary?
Bella Romari	If I were not seated, I would embrace you in three movements like a sonata.  Ah, my wonderful one. Fly with me tonight. We will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies.
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez -— this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
Cloven hoof?
I don't know.
I haven't said anything of the sort.
And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -—will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.
No, she's with her sister,
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
Thank you, my dear.
She's not been here for a long time.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
Of course.
We haven't even begun tea yet.
Oh, no problem. It can wait.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
What's the first?
No.
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
You had sex with you therapist?
Well, I wasn't always impotent.
Ann. Hello.
All of these are interviews?
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
Maybe you want to go.
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
It won't. Are you ready?
When we're making love?
At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
Yes.
Yes.
You said you weren't always impotent.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
But I don't understand --
I don't know. Possibly.
Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine.
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know?
You did that?
Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
Why don't I believe you?
You've made your point.
I want out of this marriage.
We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
Not very often.
You bitch. I knew it.
What do you mean?
I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
Is he still at your house?
That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
What do you mean? I don't understand.
Yes.
Why?
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
I have a pretty good idea.
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
Well, what, then?
You touched him?
You are in trouble.
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
You are in serious trouble.
It looks like a tablecloth.
Bye.
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
Nope.
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
Whichever you prefer.
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
He said that my hand felt good.
Okay.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
I did.
Look, I'll call you, okay?
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
You told Ann about this?
You trust him.
Look, are we going to do it or not?
Did he put you up to this?
No.  You said three-fifty?
How about for five hundred?
You were prying before?
What do you mean?
I'm not going to give you my keys.
Goddamit...
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
No, nothing.
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
Nick, you're so strange...
Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.
Well, at least you still talk the same.
But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
It's crazy.
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
OK, Rog. See you at ten.
NIGHT NIGHT
Good!  I'm gonna be there.
Of course.
I got it!  I got it!!!
You got it!
Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...
Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
I don't want to get up there.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
Sure thing.
Who?
What show?
Why?
You're practically naked!
YOUNG BLOOD
Do you really think so?
Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
Fabulous!
Foods!
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
YOU'RE NO GOOD
SIN-I-FUL
In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
We're not confused.
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
Good. That's good.
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
They're just leftovers.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Stephanie.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Good. How're you?
Not so bad yourself.
Yeah, Conundrum.
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
Oh yeah. Much better.
It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
Now we're talking.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
What color is it supposed to be?
Huh.
Yeah, that would be a good move.
If that's what feels right.
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
Shut up.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
So what's the plan today?
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
With Maya?
She's been leaving messages here too.
I will.  See ya!
Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
Deep.
Understanding of what?
She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!
Nope.
Could be anything.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
What's happening?
Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
What's up?
Thanks.
Huh. Let me think.
Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
The plan is... you go.
Hold on.
Why don't you come in?
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
Sure.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
Yeah. Definitely.
"The Day After Yesterday."
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
Yeah. Thanks.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
Like what a fraud he was.
Yeah.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Ken.
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
Not me. I'm not drinking.
I'm pregnant.
Both.
Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
He had to make a phone call.
Where?
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water?
She doesn't answer me either.
Don't touch him.
...I will.
It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
Yes, it was.
Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
What's furry, furry rabbit?
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
We have to go in the basement.
Should we make a run for it out the back?
Me too.
Yes.
Don't do it.
Who wrote this book?
Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
Sounds made up.
You're scaring your sister.
Yeah baby. I think someone did.
The footprints.
There are none.
Sounds like a virus.
No.
Pinned? What does that mean?
Don't worry.
What do you mean, the horses?
That's why they got you in jail?
There's nobody coming?
Your next water ain't for three days.
Yeah... maybe. So long.
Where's Jake?
I guess I put a good scare into him.
How's Mr. Parker doing?
That I do.
And they were two of them. Look --
Not for five years.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
Where's Turley?
Going to Turley, was it?
I expect.
I expect.
Which way do you mean?
Oh, I was just checking the, ah...  ...you know, lookin' in.
I'll be around.
Believe it.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
The other guy drew first.
We didn't get that far.
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
All I did was kiss the girl.
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
You're kidding.
Shut up. You need help, don't you?
Good luck, Mal.
Where's Emmett now?
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
This is a lot of money.
I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
Me too. What's wrong with us?
Who's the owner?
That's the good stuff.
He left me.
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
Difficult.  I'm difficult.
-- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
Good to see you too, Elaine.
Almost right.
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
Soon.  Soon.
-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
Not if I don't let her.
How much wine have you had?
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
... so much like her?
Yes, call me Simone.
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Is that a problem?
Please put your clothes on
You don't secretly want the attention?
Who are you really?
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Clyde.
But she's right there!  I must feel her!
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
You want me to call Security?
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
I've seen them all before.
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
I'm already dead.
Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
Why?
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Really?  Too bad.
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
No, that was me.
I could get the death penalty.
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
I'm keeping it in trust.
Er,... good.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
My God, you've got one?
Long live the First Amendment.
What do you want -- ?
-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
You're in breach.
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
Yes, I'd like that.
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
Yes.  Yes, it is.
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
We can keep it in the bathroom.
--Do I know you?
Goodnight, sweetheart.
I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
If it's okay with you?
Next time I won't be scared of you.
I guess they don't.
See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
Dr. Crowe.
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
Yes.
I don't know.
I don't know, Cole.
Don't fail me.
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
Maybe.
Yes.
They scare me too sometimes.
Ghosts.
I know.
Stop looking at me.
Who!
How'd he know I'd come?
Chicken blood on the crops.
Nope.
I ain't never played a banjo in my life.
Slut.
Sorry.
No shit.
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
Harvest moonshining!
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
I don't think so.
I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
Who you callin' "boy?"
You got something against farm people, Keith?
Amen.
About what?
Let it go.
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
Don't look.
Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
Us? We been... moonlighting.
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
Bill, we need to talk!
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
Just checking out the lights.
I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
We're coming your way, man!
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
Yeah.
Sorry.
I got to leave my post.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
Brought you munchies.
What can I do you for?
How many you need?
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
Out.
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
Okay.
Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
Through a wound on his stomach?
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
Hey, look!
Margaret.
Your what?
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
You paying for the gas?
Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
Okay.
We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Eleven.
Enjoy your Kenworth.
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
Yeah?
That man is your father?!?
Yes.
Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
Go.
Can a pig whistle?
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
Not for long, you ain't.
I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.
Yeah, guy?
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
I ran into complications.
Then don't.
You okay?
It's gonna be close. Real close.
Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
Then it must be a helluva idea.
Now, you just find him, son.
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
Of course. Yes.
Maybe.
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
-- he was wearing one of our jackets.
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
You woulda?
Damn... alright then.
Your attitude sucks.
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
They what? What? No. No. Why?
I thought Heller was a double op?
His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection.
We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
-- will be handled back in --
...He does now...
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
I don't see it like that at all.
Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
That's the punchline, y'ready?
None whatsoever.
Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
Got hit twice.
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
Can it work?
You're not Gibarian...
All right.
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
In the lab.  With her, probably.
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
Yes.
Yes.
He'll let me in.
How much sleep?
I don't know.
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
Just get him to stop.
Her oxygen would have run out.
I want you inside me right now.
You didn't look very happy.
Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
It's something.
How old were you?
You don't know?
It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
Not this time.
Gibarian.  He was here.
Rheya --
You're lying.  I'm not human.
Thank you.
Neither did I.
You must have been dreaming.
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
There's a phone in the car.
Queens... You know Queens?
Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
Beg pardon?
Listen, that was my fault.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
They're kind of fuzzy.
No kidding.
Absolutely.  Look at this.
I'll miss you, Mike...
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
They called here after you left...
Not exactly.
Do you dance?
Yeah...
Yeah.  It's all over.
You take care.
Not if you don't want me to.
Just putting in an appearance then.
... I don't want to talk about it...
Sure we are, let's go!
Too kinky.
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
Get in bed.
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
You don't want to hear about it.
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
I had to follow her to a store.
Ellie, it was a formal party...
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
Did you hear what I said?!!
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
You heard me.
What about Tommy?
I'm all right.
Me neither.
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
No, I need'm now!
Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.
Be happy.  He's good at this.
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
I brought the girl.  She's outside.
I'll prove it!
Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
Yeah, I think so.
Shooting?
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
You stop him?
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
Harry…
Don't be pitiful.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
Hmf-hrr?
A spider.  Eight legs.
How about tomorrow?
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
I-- uh--
Does it have a human name?
I've gotta study.
What's your problem?
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
I'm here...
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
Oh, Peter. A zit.
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
See?  You big dullard.
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
What?
Bonkers.
Is you all little Adolfs?
Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
We'll get some more.
I don't know anymore.
Who is it?
Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
We're looking at it.
You betcha. I said one of us is a stoolie. A dirty, stinkin' stoolie!
Sefton!
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
Raus! Raus! All of you!
Stop it, Harry!
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
He's the grrrrreatest!
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!
You hold him. I'll slug him.
Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
Let me alone.
Why, sure!
Animal! Animal! Wake up!
This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
Good.
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane?  C'mon Joey -- don't be afraid.
Are we boring you?
We did it.
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
You starting that again?
I called it the last time, didn't I?
He's a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him phony dogtags --
You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Just what makes you so popular?
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
Here. Take them.
Not particularly.
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
Where is he?
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
I believe so.
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
Approximately two hundred thirty million.
I have to find a way to get to Soran.
Agreed.
I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions. I am unable to articulate the sensation.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
What happened to you?
But why destroy a star?  Thank you, Guinan.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
All of us.
Yes, where would you go?
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
And what would that be, sir?
Phasing? To where?
Where are the deflector relays?
I always do.
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
Aye, aye, sir.  Take the wheel, Commander.
No. Thank you.
Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
Thank you.
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes.
Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
Lock phasers and return fire!
Execute!
Soon, Captain... Quite soon.  
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Nothing. As before.
What did you see, Chekov?
Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
On screen.
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
Short range scan.
And Spock with it. They are joined together.
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
"... If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger." I know the book, Saavik.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
None that I can detect, sir.
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us...
Goodbye, David.
Much is at stake...
The ship... Out of danger...?
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
Come on!
Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
But, why?

"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
He would not have spoken of it openly.
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
... Yes...
... Spock...
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
Success, my lord.
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.

Wait!... Wait...
You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
All true.
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
Ah.
I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't.
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
Young. I feel young, Doctor.
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?
Is that a poem?
I know, I know...
Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
But we can't just sit here -- !
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
Never mind! Hurry!
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
I'm Doctor Marcus!
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
I don't know.
Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space.
Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
Visual --
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
Here it comes. Now, Spock.
Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
A few shots, sir.
Try the emergency channels...
Scotty, let's have it.
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Aye, sir.
All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to --
The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
Be careful, Jim...
Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
HURRY.
They just don't want us going in there.
At what.
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
Trying, sir!
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
Never, sir.
By the book...
I exaggerated.
Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
Just a couple of kooks...
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
Yeah.
A moment alone, please.
Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
What do you think, Spock?
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts.
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
Name?
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
We are launching everything we have.
Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
Is there something wrong with the one I have?
Why's that?
Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
What's what?
You want the details?
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
Yes?
I see.
Right.  Will you help us?
No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
Aye, sir!
Yes, sir.
Nothing... I should never have left him...
Mr. Scott -- how soon?
Humpbacked - people.?
Two?
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
Tell her I feel fine...
Why?
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
... an offlander?
I thought it might begin the healing process.
You're what?
I understand.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
The artificial lifeform was right?
Yes. But look at this medscan...
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
I don't know.
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
Understood.
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
May I talk to you alone?
They... are in opposite directions, sir...
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
Fail-safe?
So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
... had regenerated.
I'll be in Engineering.
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
Deck ten.
Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
You've not aged a day since then?
Make it so.
I'm not letting go of him.
No, sir...
Picard to Crusher...
No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
But it's comfortable.
And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
Activating injector assembly.
It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
I look forward to reading your report.
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
Not yet.
Bag him.
I do not know what you are referring to.
A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
Where's the Sphere?
According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
But how?
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
I told you, there's no --
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
There should be an access hatch nearby...
There should be some kind of manual release...
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
Altitude fifty kilometers...
As they used to say... all systems are go.
I'm on it...
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
No... I'm from France.
Worf... torpedo... now!
They did it... they assimilated Earth.
Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
Agreed. Options?
Understood!
We've lost Bridge control!
We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
The charge is murder.
We DO sleep lying down.
Suppose HE'S holding a grudge?
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
Don't remind me.
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
Stand...?
They'll make it look like an accident...
I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
Very much.
How can I trust --
Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
Those words WERE spoken by me.
Uhura, monitor!
She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.
She programmed the torpedo hits?
Onscreen.
Kill him! He's the one!!
Energize...
Captain, if --
Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
I am uncertain.
Why would they give them to us?
Not yet... Section 4236...
... is to trust him.
WE SURRENDER.
Such things have happened before, sir.
Not as yet, sir.
What is it?
What's left of it.
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
I think  not.
Nevertheless.
What exactly does that mean?
At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
I am in a room with lights.
No.
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
Is he very much like you were?
Dying?
Mister Worf, accompany Data please.
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
Fire!
Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
Do you have a name, sir?
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?

Do you have a moment, sir?
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
How could I not?
I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
You sick bastard!
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
What do we know about the population?
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
Yes.
I know.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
New worlds.
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.
I won't defend my life to you.
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
We are.
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
What about Picard?
But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
It is... invigorating.
Should I raise shields?
Yes, Praetor.
A matter of hours now.
What?!
FULL STOP AND FIRE !
They're holding position.
None.
I came this far alone ...

I don't want to scare them away.
I don't think so... 
I understand.
No.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
When can we expect containment?
It's taken on a disguise.
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
Shermin...
I'm afraid we can't let you go.
Marc Shermin.
Ah no.
That way.
Money.
Smile.
Minneapolis.
What are you doing?
No gas.
I am Jenny Haydn.
I am...
From?
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
Shit!
It was yellow.
I do not understand.
Three nights... two days.
No.
No.
Is that a baby?
Do you have a baby?
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
Yes.
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Goodbye.
I was afraid.
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
I don't understand 'friend.'
He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
He will.
Why?
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
I must meet my ship.
No.
What for?
I understand.  Thank you.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
Yes.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Give it a rest, Lyman.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
Doesn't make sense.
I did.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Wait'll you see it.
It could have been anything.
We better get it into the box. Come on...
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.
No problem.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
Watch and see.
I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.
Damn right.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!
Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
I'm on her.
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
But this is a bad one.
Why me?
What do you mean?
That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
Naawww.
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
Fumitsu.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
Black.  Jack.
This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
Now you're really getting paranoid.
OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
S'okay.  I know you still love me.
No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
The gas tank's going to go any second!
Fire's out, isn't it?
How long does it last?  Oh.
Yeah, right, blow it open.
Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
You never told me.
Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
Uh unh.
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night.  Eddie, we're walking in. Everything covered?
She's buried.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?
You know, you ever think about other women?
Take a look, Harold. Tell me if you see anything you want. You do like to look, don't you?
Not bad, huh?
Why me? What do you want from me!?
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
What kind?
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
Who?
From the grave?
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
Then why do I still have a badge?
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
They like my stories. They like the way I think. They're into fantasy. I turn them on.
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
I was visiting an old college friend.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!
Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
Not especially.
That information's being withheld from the media.
And one other thing.
My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
Don't be too harsh.
No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
What did you tell him?
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
Suspect Zero.
And you're working with him?
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
How are we going to find him?
Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me.
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
How do you know who's real and who's not?
I already have an employer.
Yeah.
Lead the way, Murman.
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
What did you do to end up here?
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Sounds like fun.
I screwed up twice, sir.
Yes, sir.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.
I know, I know.
You're right. I know.
Shuddup.
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.
You're a comedian?
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
You better pay the man.
Yes. Like the quiche.
Just like that?
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
Uh, if the guy wants to.
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
Oh. You know.
...and even then...
...then ask where you met her...
No.
Don't worry. He's in good hands.
No matter what... like splitting aces.
I'm a "Dorothy".
Did you get it?
Sorry?
Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.
No...
Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
Listen. I had a great time.
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
Are you on the other line?
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might...
Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
I heard you might be moving back...
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
There's the rub.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
Classy.
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
Well, let's hit that party.
Go for it, man.
I'll be your winger.
No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
...He's derivative...
Not well.
You asshole.
...People get carjacked...
...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
She's really special, guys.
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is... 
Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
Hang on, Voltaire.
I don't know...
I don't know...
What?
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
What are you talking about? Look at all the honeys.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
Well, you look money, baby. We both look money.
What?!?
I know, but...
But I lost! How can you say always?!?
Let's go.
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress...
That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
No, baby. You're money.
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
What?!?
What? That was the best part of the old game.
It starts at eight...
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
We're not messing with you...
A day.
Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
You could make their heads bleed, though.
...It's on.
What was cold about it?
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
What'd you want me to do? Back down? He called me a bitch. We kept our rep.
...it's definitely on.
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
An eye for an eye!
I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
Shut up.
I'm not hungry yet.
Yeah.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
No, just you and Paulie.
OK, but be careful.
No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
What are you, a dance judge?  Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.
And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
Sure.
You understand him better than anyone.
It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
Barzini.
Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.
Tom said he'd take care of it.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
How did you find out?
I'll need him.
Yes.
Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
Where are you going?
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
Can you do it Mike?
We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
Mama, no.
Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
Michael...
Michael you're trying to scare me...
I told you you wouldn't like him.
Sure.
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
How is your father?
I'm busy.
Let me think about it, O.K.?
Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
What?
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic.
Thanks.
Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.
You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
Is that good?
I don't get it.
I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
Your parents met her.
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
What?
I played piano in a few places.
Copy out from here...
Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman.
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
I'm prepared to take the blame.
You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
Sure.
Dickie?
Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
Far cry from New York.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
What about Cortina?
Ha. Did he say why?
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
Dickie did it.
Hello Marge!
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
And you, sir? Any better?
Why do you have Dickie's rings?
What are you going to do now, Tom?
I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
I hope so.
Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.
Exactly. 10.30 -- 
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
You know what -- I am.
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
Not at all. Morning Tom.
It's okay.
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate.
He says so many fiancées.
You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
I'm fine.
You try. You try talking to her.
I give up.
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Well that would be even better gossip.
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
November, I thought.
No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat.
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
You have, yes.
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
Huh?
Huh?
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
My name is Travis.
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
I'm leaving.
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
Yeah.
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
Kidding around... you know, fun.
Have you been noticing anything strange?
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
This is gotta be a game, right?
You sure he's not Italian?
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
Show me how he did that again.
Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
What did you do?
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
The cops and company raise hell they find out.
I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
In the jungle. 122nd.
Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long.  That cigarette burns out, your time is up.
Easy.
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
You can do it in my mouth.
That's not hard to do.
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
I... I don't get along with people like that.
Besides, I've got to stay here.
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
Damn straight.
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
Oh?
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
Hey Wizard.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
You want to talk about it?
What is happening?  Where's Mason?
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?
It's all I could think of.
Wrong.
Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
I am, too.
I wish you were coming with me.
Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
Damn...
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
Yes.  Hic!
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
Exactly.  And he got good.
No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.
Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.
The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.
What's that?
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
A super market.  Huh.
Can't wait.
Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
... Ernie.
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
Yes.
Did you... did you...
Anybody take it?
Bought the bottle, didn't I?  To the United States of America. Long my she wave.
Thanks.
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
Call me... Ishmael?
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
What's his rent?
Huh?
Who the hell is this "they?"
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
I was decorated.
Why not?
"Ashes To Ashes?"
So, it is a blacklist.
That's not the country Luke fought for.
No thanks.
Luke didn't smoke.
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
When was that?
What?
We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?
Yeah... me too.
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
Thank you.
Yes?
Yes.
If you have some, I'd...
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
Because she was afraid.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
Cathy!
No!
Take them.
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Shhh. Shhhhh.
It's Alice.
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
Mmmm.
Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world...
What happened?
Shall I call the doctor?
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
Mother, where did you go to law school?
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
Mother?
But they'll be back.
If they are?
No, not exactly.
Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
Yes.
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
Would you like me to go for her?
What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? Ain't much we can do about it. 
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
Yes.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
We met in court.
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
He was watching a ball game on television.
How does Mother know what I like to do?
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
I wrote the letter.
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
What do you want ?
You have a job?
I'm glad you do.
What'll it say?
Yes.
I'll get it.
Mmm?
With my little sparrow leading team.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
Almost two a.m.
I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.
You said three o'clock.
And he'll talk?
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
With smoke.
Can we go on living here otherwise?
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or...
Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
Ask this one favor --
Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like to give you cause for courage -- Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I think he's the greatest man in medicine.  God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure.
It's not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.
It is a pity.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
Aye.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --
I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
What?
You've no thought of going there?
Why, yes.
I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
I am the best man for the job.
That's a good boy, Toddy.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
Three years.
I'll get him.
He must leave me alone.
Aye.
I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.
I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
Good thing in a situation like this.
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
He didn't kill her.
I told you, I knew your sister.
No! Why are you haunting me?
Yeah, I know.
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
Yeah, we do.
Good for you. You do know something.
He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
You mean Alex.
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
I do. Every day.
Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean... look at her.
What did I say?
About you.
He'll be there at 8:30.
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
That was my first question.
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
That's what I came to see you about.
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
Yes.
Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
Yes -- I think so.
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
About 250 million of your miles.
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
Thank you... Have you any news?
Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
Come on in.
Is that what you're thinking about?
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
Where is the meeting going to be?
He'll have you -- and Tom.
I'm sorry.
Would you like to sell it?
I'd give you a very good price.
How long will that take?
He's my brother.
El Vampiro.
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
<u>Four</u> to go.
Honda 250, huh?
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
What?
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
This is Michael.
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
I like Michael.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
I'm tired now.
What's that smell?
Smells like something died.
I thought we were poor.
You've heard this story before?
Soon.
Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
We can't talk about it on the phone.
He's already gone to bed.
Hi, Thorn.
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
I hope so.
Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
Okay.  Talk.
Star.
What do you mean?
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
Okay.
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
Save Laddie first.
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
Nanook...
Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!
He was protecting <u>you</u>!
Huh?...
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
So what's our problem?
Anybody sick?
I don't know who to trust.
Cool it, Palmer!!
Ain't it there?
Was dark... find a light...
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
Look, I'm just guessing...
I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
We got morphine, don't we.
We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
I guess I'm the only one.
Thank you.
A couple of hours.
Little over two hours.
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
He's dead.
Screw the flashlights.  Where the hell were you?
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
MacReady, that you?
It's the generator I think!  No power.
When do you think it got to him?
Can't hear you.
I had an accident.
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
I'm so sorry, Kalen.
What else can they do?
1899.
Last night.
I will...
As slaves.
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.
A man can change his history.
Oh, you won't be running for long...
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
I -- what are you?!
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
I mean... well... affection.
And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
I have something for you...
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
What?
How romantic...
Oh?
Hiding?
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
All right, all right -- here -- everything --
Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
Your husband is dead?
More than 800,000 years.
Why not?
For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
We all have that dream.
Every night.
I can see Kalen's point.
What's it all for?
How do you decide?
You lost someone.
Someone you loved very much.
Is it?
I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
It's undamaged?
Mara...?
Here?
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
We choose to believe it.
We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
What's it like where you come from?
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
And you've no idea where he went?
We never should have done this to him...
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
And what does that mean?
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
He didn't either.
I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
Well, you belong in one.
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
[Beat] What?
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
Yeah.
Yes.
If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
It's Sunday.
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
Good. How's your mom?
I'm doing fine.
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
I could try to...make it stop.
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
Why would we do that?
Well, what time is it?
No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
I did?
Listen to me. That's all I ask.
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
[Beat] Thanks.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
What.
What?!
See ya.
No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me?
In the leg.
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
How are things goin' out there?
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
You want to come on in?
The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  Are you close with her?
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
It don't matter.  Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
I'm a robber.
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.
Peaches.
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
You wanna let me see your license, please?
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
Okay.  I will, too.
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
Isn't this fun?
Maybe.
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
Get the car.
I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
So this is all my fault, is it.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
It's probably not a good idea.
Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
Thelma kinda took to him.
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
What happened?
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
Yeah.
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
Why not?!
I... I...
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
Yeah.
You know those little dogs you see people with?
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
Gosh.  It sure is.
Thelma!
I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
What do you mean?
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
Good.
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
What?
Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
Oh.
What?!
It's grand!
All this for us?
We're not giving up, Thelma.
Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
Hi there!  You alright?
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
So you admit it?
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!
Yeah, but he was successful.
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
Never?
I don't know.
Yeah, right.
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.
Uh-huh.
I am?
Yeah feels like it.
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
Jesus Christ you're right.
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
Who?
You got a brew?
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Ahh.
Thanks.
You own a home there?
Thanks.
What's that?
-- He's in a cage?!
Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime.
Great.
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
Have you seen it?
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.
Forget it. It was... fun.
Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
Who the hell's Woogie?
I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy!
Oh, uh, I resigned.
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.
Do what?
You're a sick man, you know that?
What?
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
Maybe this'll jog your memory.
What do you mean?
And you met Mary how?
Nice.
What?
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
What's that supposed to mean?
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Where's Puffy?
Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
No short game.
Yeah?
Trying to be.
Toy poodle!
Mary, come on...
Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
What do you mean?
Great. Great.  So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
Yeah, so... I'm gonna wait and see what happens there... But that sounds great, yeah.
I think I was very clear, Ted. If everything else falls apart, maybe.
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
Bye, Ted.
We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
What --
Yes, sir.
We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
-- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.
Cuba.
Yes it is.
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
Kids are supposed to get detention.
I, uh...
Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
Not as far as the election goes.
There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.
Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.
Good. Thank you.
Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns.  That's scary shit.
That's what it looks like, doesn't it? But that's what a ten gauge, choke-bored, shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away.
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.
She's that subtle?
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
Yes.
The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn.
After we've completed our investigation.
Watch out!
Bullshit.
Why should I tell you.
The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
Yeah. Fitful dreams.
So they took care of Leo.
What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
Move it, Magdelana.
NO.  My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy.
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
Go ahead, Ray.
Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
What the fuck you talkin' about?
What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
Leo Fast Elk... is alive.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
I was inverted.
You know. The finger.
You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.
For what?
Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
Evan... or Maverick.
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work.
It's not suffering anymore.
Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?.
Where?
Why?
In that order?
Where'd you get it.
Do what, show you a good time?
I like to play "reality".
Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
How does it go?
What truth?
Take something off.
...Something like that.
Right on the flight line?
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
What is he doing?
Roger, I've got it.
You go. I'm staying with it.
Well what?
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
So's my Johnson.
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.
Nothing. Let's just go fight.
Come on. I died enough for one night.
What'd you do?
Was.
He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing.  He just can't seem to follow orders!
GOT 'EM.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
We did it.
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
The wings..
My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
No bother.
Or....
Definitely.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
What is it?
It's not my fault.  We hit a memory cap.
Come on...put his head in place.
I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
That's right.
Where's Kuato?
C'mon!
Rekall?
Oh, Rekall.
Harry!
Let me buy you a drink.
Come on, let's go have that drink.
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
Up!
How did I get in this taxi?!
Drive!  DRIVE!!
Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
You know I do.
Just think about it.
Some men just tried to kill me!
Take it easy.  Tell me exactly what happened?  Why would "spies" want to kill you?
Oh God, Doug.
It was implanted by the Agency.
Implanted.
I'm here at Rekall.
Mars.
What's in the two week package?
Come on, don't bullshit me.
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?
Blondes.
What are you talking about?
Hauser left me a note.
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
I used to model for 'em, why?
I saw them.
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
It's just up ahead.
Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."
Ready as we'll ever be.
Well, who put you two in charge?
I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
Do not talk to the driver.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.
Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
That's the plan.
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
Fifteen lousy bucks.
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.
I think we wait right here.
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
No ties.
She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?!
She wants to lay down.  I'm a little worried.
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
Yeah, Val.
We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
Okay, ten dollars.
Yeah, geography.
Around here?  Why would they?
Let's assume that it is.
Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
Sustained.
-- With objection!
Do you see a toilet here you think is really me?
-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
I didn't take my eyes off it!
No further questions.
I specialize, Roger...
So go take your job on Wall Street.
-- Remember?
Eddie... I don't know about this...
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
What's Art Esparza?
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
...For ten years, now.
Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
Exactly what happened then?
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
You tell me, man.
It's okay, Eddie.
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
Y-yes, sir.
Mr. Rabin has no right to --
I'd have that checked, Mr. Reynard.
You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu.
That's big of you, Bob.
Calls for speculation.
We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
-- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
For control of the prison drug trade?
Yeah, we do some of that.
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
Soldado.
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
And you b-believe that.
A woman.
I want you.
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
Here he comes.
What was?
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
I am going over here.
An old woman and her grandson.
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
Smell something fishy, huh?
Teresa Banks.
You are here and there is no place to go...
Ever see her with someone else?
Did she ever mention any friends?
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
That's good.
I don't know, Sam.
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
He probably wanted to drive over.
I don't know what to do.
Maybe.
Well, why not?
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
What can I tell you?
WE got it back, that's all.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
Brother, I hear you talkin'.
Who would do that?
Let's go all the way.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
Not now.
I can't tonight.
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
I understand.
What were you doing in my room?
I'm sorry, Mom.
It's a school night... back by nine.
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
But my name isn't Leland Palmer.
...school's fine...
A friend from school.
We're late to get to your mother.
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
Stay away from me.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.
Lay off the bennies, Leo.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
Yes. It would be.
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
No.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
I'm on the staff of...
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
Yes.
Yes.
Well, we...
Yes.
...We did everything we could...
My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
...that's all right.
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
I completely understand...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
...What difference would...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
Yes. I wrote it.
I. Yes. It is.
Yes.
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
Why?
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
...that's perfectly all right.
To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
How old is he?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
I'm sure you would.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Overruled...
And what are you? A cop?
Do you want me to go...?
I've got to work.
I... do you want me to leave?
If I don't 'grow up...'
Stop pressuring me...
Mr. Alito, please.
Let me talk to Mickey.
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
Missus...
No.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
It's locked.
...I'm sure you do...
...I know. I went...
Yes.
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
He's... you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.  He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
That's for sure, Frank.
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file.
Don't touch anything.
...I'm going to need your help...
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
Oh shit, what's today?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
I'm swell.
Yeah.
We got to talk.
I don't want a mistrial.
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
Yes, that's correct.
As I've said we had some more...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.  We were trying to restore her...
Should I?
Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!
I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.
Would you like some coffee, General?
No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!
I bought it for the square dance. I thought I ought to wear some- thing Western.
It's gone now.
I liked him.
That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!
I wonder if they're going through this too...?
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
It might give us something.
Are they sure it's a meteor?  It didn't come down like one.
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
Welcome to California!
So?
Yes, but...
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
Maybe you should tell me your dream.
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
What?  What kind of episode?
Heather, has there been another call?
Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
No.
No.
Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him.  Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
Read me some?
I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me, John?  Please!
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
They wouldn't let me...
Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
I haven't forgotten.
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
Yes sir.
Yeah, sure.
What?
You're not a moron.
I just can't believe it.
What?
What was that?
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
That's not why he's sending me.
Like this!
What's the difference?
Well that's just typical isn't it?
Me too.
Yes.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
Come on man, what'd they look like?
Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.
Yes sir.
Speak up boy!
Of what?
I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.
Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.
I know.
Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
He's a big boy.
I should be eating with the crew.
They'll know about it in the morning.
I couldn't do it.
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
Okay donut.  Whatever you say.
Look, save it for somebody else will ya.  This ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me.
What is it... the secret?
If it were only that simple, my young friend.  Read on, gentlemen. Read on.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
It seems we're short on singers.
No, Phil.  It's a mammal.
The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
I understand.
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
No, haven't heard of it.
Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here. Iguana County's one of the richest in Texas.
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
When did you talk to Lula?
She really say she was pregnant?
Forty bucks...
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
Thanks.
Set one up.
No sir...
Muchas gracias.
Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
Sailor... Lula loves you.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
I'm sorry.
Yes, that's so. But there is not much to destroy.
He is my sponsor. The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras.
The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
Thinkin' a second, baby.
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
Didn't he say somethin'?
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
That's good... Now go get yourself a beer.  You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one?
We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
What's that, peanut?
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
What's that?
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
What kinda trash talk is that?
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?
You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
Who knows, baby?
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
Yeah, I'm here.
No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
If you say so.
No radio or TV...
Okay, honey, I'll see you later.
The only one.
I'll come along.
And Bobby too, I hear...
Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
Shake hands with your daddy.
What makes sense, is all.
SAILOR!!!!
Damn!
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
Mama, Sailor's in deep trouble here. I just can't leave him.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
What if I told you not to?
Santos... It isn't.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
Shoot him.
See! I knew you had it all under control.
So?
It's a prob'lm I don't think's gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny California.
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
You heard right.
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.
Only in your bones?
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
Ye-es?
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
Just what? Doing a little dusting?
Are you there to not reconcile with her?
No! What gave you that idea?
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.
Heaven?
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?
What'd he say?
That's a big book you're writing.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
Blocked.
Hm.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
No.
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
Jealous? Of me?
I didn't mean it that way.
Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
Just checking.
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
Oh. Well. I...
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
Who does?
I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
Yes.
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
Really, Sara, I...
About the baby.
Inside.
Over there. In the backseat of the...
I told Walter.
I know, but sometimes...
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
James is... I don't know...
I'm not sure that's possible.
Tony. Now that I'm home.
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
This is important.
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Her husband.
Hey, Professor Tripp.
As a heart attack.
Why did you come here, Grady?
Just kidding.
I might have his number on campus.
I doubt it, darling.
You want to keep him happy.
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
How old is Anna?
Huh?
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
Next week? The week after?
Sure.
Ask me. Ask me anything.
Birds.
Sure.
Their sound is quite musical.
That was terrific.
You live around here?
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
It's my bird book.
Yeah.
You can't talk to me like --
Okay.
No.
No.
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
You're a cop. Figure it out.
Yeah.
You are in.
What?
Why's that?
Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.
Lovers' quarrel?
Can I ask how old you are?
No you're not.
Does he?
Your daddy will always love you.
Robin, listen to me.
Will I see you again?
The job's okay.
A diary?
Of course.
Forget it.
I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.
I'm not that crazy.
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.  That's my idea of being normal.
I said I was sorry.
You mean my problem?
Why?
Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
We're little kids.
All right.
Nothing.
Yes.
I was six years old!
I'm all right.
What do you think?
Sorry.
What?
I get that impression.
What?
Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!
You think I have a problem?
What for?
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
The worst?
How young?
What?
Sounds like a special guy.
I was always the one seduced.
What odds?
You must hate your brothers.
No you don't.
I'm not scared.
Maybe you should be.
What's it look like?
Do what?
What's your fucking problem?
We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  Now you know exactly as much as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.
Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
Hey, you okay?
Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
I'm switching off now.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
Lindsey!  Wait a second--
Now what?
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
What's the plan?
It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.
Hi, lady.
Who then?
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
Let's go, guys.
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.
We're here now.  Let's get her done.
It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
You watch yourself.
What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins? Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has known about them for years.  They abduct people all the time.  There was this woman I knew in Albuquerque who--
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
How many are there?
Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  I believe the stress is affecting you.  Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer.
Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?
Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
Check this out.
What's the timer set for?
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
There will be plenty of time to talk about it later.  We'll  get married  soon.  That way we'll have more time...
But you just said that a month was too...
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
You already know what they are.
Sir, if you have no objections, may we start the search?
More so than the shark?
Occasionally, but always with affection.
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
What! Get married?
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
Nothing.
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
To the shark.
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums.
When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
What is it?
I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?
Me... Goffredo, you're mad!  He's mad.
What boat?
Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
I don't see why I should mind.
Yes, we will.
They didn't seem too good.
Lady Patrizia!
I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
Through someone else?
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
Why?
Agnes...
Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
Oh my dear child.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
Yes Mother.
It made them holy.
It's not my time of month.
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
No I don't.
Yes.
Everyone.
Right now?
Oh, yes!
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
Yes.
Where?
Where did the baby come from?
Agnes, how are babies born?
Agnes...
I can't have them any more.
I've stopped menstruating
Does it bother you?
What?
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
No.
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
I'm always bad.
No...
She can.
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
Yes.
She says my whole body's a mistake.
And then...
No I'm not.
Yes.
No I'm not.
Doctor Livingston.
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
Yes.
What else?
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
Who?
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
It was alive wasn't it?
And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.
Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
Unfiltered.
Yes.
She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
Obviously there was.
The science of psychiatry.
So, someone else could have done it.
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
Then help her.
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
Nothing...
Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth.  No more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles.  Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.
NO... no... I said leave her alone.
You think she's a saint?
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
I have a few more questions to ask her.
Is it because she's a nun?
I didn't guess until it was too late.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Y'what?
Yeah?
Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
They'll be here.
Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
Oh, yes, now I'm with you. [he changes his accent] But, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ...
I've made the scene.
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
Of course I can.
Have I said something amiss?
I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
We do.
He hasn't.
If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?
What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
I'll look in here again.
Oh, sorry I spoke.
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
And cunning.
See you.
You can learn from books.
Books are good!
Parading?
What's that mean?
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
What?
Lip reading.
Eh?
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... 
But I'm clean.
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Why do you always use your left hand?
Here, Pauly.
Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
Hiding.
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
So's mine.
Can't he? He's done it, son!
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
Ah, go on, you swine.
Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
We were going to do it.
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
Hello.
Oh yes.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
I would have said so.
I knew I could rely on you.
Oh, leave off!!!
I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
Oh, down the ... er ...?
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
But John hasn't got any.
Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
... I don't know...
Where the hell are we?
I'll see what I can do.
Activated.  Vertical drop checked. Correcting course.  On tangential course now, orbiting.  Crossing the terminator.  Entering night side.
What's the terrain down there?
Then take her down.
Looks like a derelict.
Take a look.
You want to try?
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
Has the hull been breached?
Dead.
The water will still recycle.
-- And the cooling unit on the other.
Damn it!  How long to fix?
Here, let me try.
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
I kind of like it.
Well we better do something.
Poison gas...
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
Yeah, but how?  His nose and mouth are blocked.
It wouldn't come.
The door was closed.  It must still be in here.
Sounds like a rough one.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
I can't, the acid will pour out!
I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled.
It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.
I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
We can use the flamethrower.
I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
Is it armed?
Thanks for the thought. 
You lead.
Sun will be down in a minute.
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
Can you see anything?
<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!
Let's let the machine work on him.
Room by room, corridor by corridor.
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
Close...
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
Right.  Fire up all systems.
Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for. Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source?
Good.  I'm getting you clear too. Let's just keep the line open.
Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he?  We can see what happened to him.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --
They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
Even simple.
Go ahead, Jay.
Let's be democratic.
Right now let's keep it closed.
What's that supposed to mean?
So the next step should be --
Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core.  In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.
Here, carry these.
What did it do to you?
Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
Thanks.
Oh man...
Too many.
We're not gonna make it, are we?
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
Yeah?
That's impossible, man.  This fence is high-tensile.  The breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it up.
Yeah, I got it.
Just behind us, over to the right.
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
Thanks.
Where does that lead to?
Okay.
And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
Right.  When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of there.  Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke some kind of response.
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
Only six?
Check out the tent.
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
Don't wait for me!
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow.
What time's sundown?
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
Phoebe.
I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
Yes. The Shubert.
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...
I'm in love with Lloyd!
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
Not with me, you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class.
More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.
What of it?
She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
No-no-no...
You can have one at Max's.
Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it...
Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for.
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
And too many of them are produced.
Then you've heard too.
We have that in common.
Being violently ill to her tummy.
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Where?
Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten-  - and you're going to be on time.
I'm a junk yard.
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses... isn't it silly, suddenly I've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle...
I'll try.
And cut that out right now.
That I am...
A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
How is Eve? Okay?
I had no idea you were even here.
Nothing, really...
Eve?  How enchanting...  Wherever did you get the idea of having Eve read with Miss Caswell?
So full of meaning, fire and music!
I've been aware of that for some time.
I'll say.
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.
What would you like? Texas?
You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.
A married lady.
I'm going to have a home. Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it. I'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be... remember, Karen?
Why.
So am I.
I know. She just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo.
Buy some.
Just because you can't even work a zipper. It was very thoughtful, Eve, and I appreciate it-
Do you want an argument or an answer?
Now you want an argument.
Like an agent with one client.
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
Probably not.
Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
Subway.
Oh, no...
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
Not at all.  Margo, this is Eve Harrington.
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
I won't forget.
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
There can't be very much-
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
I'll never get over it.
Over my dead body...
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
The heave-ho.
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
Three or four miles...
What about Bill?
In a minute...
That was a pity...
That's quite a change of subject.
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
Now just a minute-
Margo!
I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
What is he talking about?
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
What do you mean?
Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
I have no intention of having an accident!
I mean really, deeply angry...
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
Would you?
Well...
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
--you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
That happens to people.  OK, go on.
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
--shit, who do we know?--
--Haldeman I know, who else?
So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
You asking would I have been one of the President's men?  I would have been.
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
It's nothing personal, though. 
Maybe we are...
--and the FBI confirms--what more do you need?--
Hmm?
Goddamnit!--
--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
11:30.
Night.
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
--Howard Hunt?
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
--yes--
--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
I could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts.  Put him on.  Ken, I'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut and they were having a crisis, what's up, kid?  Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled.  A wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken.  Ken, I would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night-- unless, of course, you force me to.
Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.
There's always a later plane.
I don't know what they'd do to me.
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
Which people?
Sloan knew which five, didn't he? 
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
How senior?
I don't know titles.
Electronic surveillance.
So?
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
...check...?
...you're definitely doing a story...?
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
James McCord.
Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
--well, Sloan--
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
Could develop.
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
Haldeman.  Right?
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
-- Thanks, coach --
Sure.
I'm not good in math.
Pardon me?
Single malt?
Seduce her.
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Why is this?
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
You can call me Ostreicher.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
Because I want to.
How did you know I was here?
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
You called me Oz.
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
Sure.
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Did you guys hook up or something?
Then what the hell are you talking about?
Uh...
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
Pontificated.
Right.  That gives us...
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Went home to shit.
He's going in!
Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
I told you.
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.
What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!
Okay!
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Not for you.
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Yeah, are you?
Yeah, right here.
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
What's that?
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
Then where does a blowjob figure in?
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
Dude, prom sucks.
Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
I don't care.
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
I think we're falling in love.
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
Dude, he does not.
This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are <u>hot</u>.
No shit.
No way.
I'd use pills. They're painless.
Also like sex with my wife.
What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium.  The planet earth. It's good to be back.
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
A la votre.
Andy! No!
A cure?
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
Yeah. French fries...
Fuck me...
What...?
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
You'll never get the chance.
And you call me a moron...
Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
Why isn't it doing anything!?
This is... it's like a sick joke, I -
He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
Yeah?
Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News...
Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
I told him it wasn't ready...
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -
I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
How to read.
I know, but I had to because . . .
No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
I shant!
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
What happened to your parents?
I have my reasons.
That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
Now just get off the train.
You are the Princess.
Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
Don't be
I'm glad you	did too.
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
Ah! Let us begin!
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
M'mm.
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
M'm.
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
You-you play... very well.
Oh, no, I have a car.
Me? Oh, downtown!
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
No, Chippewa Falls.
Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
Well, where is it? I-
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Don't be funny.
Huh? Oh... yeah.
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Neat, yeah.
Fifteen years, yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
It's terrific.
No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
Yeah?
M'hm.
U-huh.
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
You are extremely sexy.
Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
Are yuh?
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
Whatta you mean? Me?
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh?
What thing?
All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
Yeah.
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
You're mad, aren't you?
Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
Why are you so hostile?
Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."
Commentary.
Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
"Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."
My head is throbbing.
I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
Tell him.
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
Trigger.
Hey.
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
I don't know, I mean, I-
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
V.P.L.?
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.
I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
She was stealing.
If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
We really had a good time.
No.
You think so? Do you really?
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance.
I don't know. I don't know.
You should talk to Mr. Joe.
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
One guess.
Absolutely not.
I'm not that good.
The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I?  Wouldn't I?
And how's the diva doing?
She's got great tits.
And you've only just met.
Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
What?
Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.
What?
Didn't I say?
I'd say it was down.
You want a Tylenol, or something?
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
Don't you miss it?
Really?
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
Yeah.
He's not going tonight.
She's in ICU.
Leave us alone right now.
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
Give him a minute, Clair.
He's directing now.
Did you tell Joe to behave?
Before I forget.  Put it on the bookshelf.
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.
Who'd like to go and find Otis?
It's alright.  Be our guests.
Sally, calm down.  We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.
Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
It's a Calder.
Sure.
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
You're an interior decorator, right?
No you're not.
What?
And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.
I'll be your best friend.
We're way past inappropriate.
Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
Lemon.
And he doesn't smoke?
How long have you been married?
Come here.
Sorry?
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
Well...wow...
You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
Yes.
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
God willing.
Don't go in, Ryan.
How long ago was it?
Not at all.
No, never.
Oh?
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Are you asking me to marry you?
Not enough.
Oh great.
It could be worse.
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
No, really, five thousand with your discount.
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
I hope they're watercolors!
Would you like to meet my husband?
And the food sucks, I know.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
<u>What</u>?
Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
You -- you think I'm right?
I'm Princess Bala.
Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
Want a list?
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Hlllllllp!
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
Well...no, but --
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
And do Princesses do improper things?
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
Oh, no, sir!
That's correct, sir!
Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
Under the mat? 
Something the matter?
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
Well, I have some paper towels --
That's me. 
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
I'd love to hear them. Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening, after work --
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
Yeah.
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
So I see.
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
How come?
Eight-thirty!
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
After all, this is a conservative firm -- I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer --
The mirror -- it's broken.
Someone from the office.
Miss. 
No -- it's my stomach.
That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --
He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
Give what up?
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?
For me?
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Are you supposed to?
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day.
No -- just come as you are.
Might as well go all the way.
You usually eat alone?
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
No, thank you.  I -- well, to tell you the truth --  -- I have this heavy date for tonight --
I'm fine.
Of course not.
Shut up and deal!
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
That's very flattering.
What kind of joint are you running?
Well, usually I slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat -- but never again -- I can promise you that --
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
Swap them? For what?
Oh?  Oh!
You too, sir.
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
I hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you.
Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --
Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc. 
How many pills were in that bottle?
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
Good night.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Get more coffee.
No.
Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
You know I liked it better long.
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
Handle what?
You know I do.
I love you -- remember?
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
Atlantic City?
He wouldn't.
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
Sssssh.
Don't you ever stop talking?
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
Yeah --
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
I said I like all of them.
One for all -- all for one --
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
Part.
My part.  Beer, with ice and water.
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
Yeah. Way north.
Sort of.
A long time.
What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
Call me what, sir?
That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
Yeah, I know.
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
Shot himself. What for ?
All right I got a little surprise for you --
Thta's not Charlie's work --
If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore.
Which way? Right or left?
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
I wonder if that was the same copter.
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
Anyone got a cigarette.
We ain't goin' down the river.
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
They must have seen the fire.
Okay, Willard, sit down.
This gentleman or myself ?
I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?
He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
A lame ?
But why ?
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
The Vietnamese think it's theirs -- I guess the Americans do, too.
Sure -- fine --
It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell.
Six to eight feet.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
I met him.
You'll find enough Cong up there.
Who?
Yes, I know.
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
Yes.
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
Why?
Why didn't he shoot you?
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
And shut up.
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
I know.
Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
I do.
You can pack out of here -- two, three days' hike along this river at most.  Weather should hold this early in the season.
Needs patching.
Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.
89   CONTINUED:
Wait 'til I'm across!
There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
Your infrared camera?
26   CONTINUED:  
Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
I don't want to talk any more.
That's my line.
I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.
Yeah.  Maybe so.
Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.
That's right.  You're not.
I don't plan on dying.
I'm right behind you.
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
You know Meyerling?
Too bad we're heading west.
You got one?
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
I'm real sad you don't approve of me.
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
You're wrong.  Everything we do leaves its mark.  You said it yourself -- there are hundred- year-old footprints in the tundra.
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
No, I better stay at my post.
You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.
Don't try me.  I'll kill you if it comes to it.
Nothing personal.
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.
Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
That's what we should've done in the first place.
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
Ease off.  We do this my way.
They'll have to come right past us.
Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
Don't be silly. How bad?
Stay out of this...  Doctor?
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Since forever.
Emergency room only.
Will you please take it?
No.
His name?
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
You all set here?
No!!! Stay away from me!
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
What's that got to do with it?
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
Nonsense!
Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.
You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
Never.
I can trust my brain.
You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?
I had to see you...
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
Yes. I really would.
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
Stop staring. Do a vase.
There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
Okay by me.
I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
'Love was... '
Okay, then.
Get out.
Oh, my gosh.
Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted.
Another place where?
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
So you're from around here?
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
I know you're going to jump.
That's right.
What?
Oh, yeah.
You're too late.
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
The contract was stolen.
A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.
Know what?
The contract?
He stole another contract.
One hour per man.
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
Until a minute ago.
No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
Right.
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
The C.I.A.?
How old were you?
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
But you knew what they were training you for?
The exotic women.
Why not?
Why?
Why did you leave the Agency?
Are they usually like that?
Does that mean it didn't bother you?
You said you didn't trust it.
Where is it?
No.
I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
Fine.
What?  What if he brings it with him?
That means you won't have a gun.
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
So?
Why?
I'm sure you will.
Are you attracted to me?
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
No.
I'm not normal.
What?
What?
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
Holidays are our busiest days.  No one likes to be alone on holidays. I know I don't.
I called because I just want... I need to talk.
Honesty.
Everyone regrets something.
Sometimes.
All the time.
Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
I hope not.
Average.
Taken.
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
Anything.
You mean quit?
I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
Thank you.
I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
Great. Let's say nine o'clock here tomorrow. Catch you later partner.
I thought that was part of the charm!
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
Thought of everything haven't you.
Tough break.
Can you do the lock on it?
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
Yeah, I'll take some.
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
No, for the Asylum.
They'll never get us.
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
Am I late?
Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
No beer?
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
She's cool.
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
So I hear.
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
What happened?
So?
Lucky break!
Siberia.
Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
You're in the clear, keep it that way, I'll be okay.
Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
Some deal you did there!
Here!
No, by road?
Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
That one?
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
So am I.
Yes.
Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
Really?
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
What?
I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
It's bad news when you can't even bribe kids.
Fernet and tonic.
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
Thanks.
No, it's not true, you're lying.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Yep, it's all yours.
Don't worry. Thanks.
Great....How long will it go for?
Ah, so what?
No, it should be over soon.
We don't need you.
The way I look at it, I've carried the camel to water and stuffed it's head under - if it doesn't drink now, we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day.
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.
I'll be okay, just get me home.
Yeah, but it was okay.
Alright!
It's Josh's.
Not all of them!
I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.
Yes, you are free to go, Karel here will drive you home.
Working....Under cover.
Later.
You bastard!
Some Americans?
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
With you.
I'll tell her you were here.
Kelly wouldn't do that.
Cuz nothing happened at school.
I don't want his money.
You're fine like that, Mom.
Thanks.
Yeah.
I meant he's a doctor.
Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing.  Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.
You do --
It was.
-- This play means a lot to me.
Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.
Why?
Go for it.
I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
Sometimes I don't even trust me.
I'm really glad you think so.
Healthy as can be.
Thank you. So were you.
You're hardly nice to anyone.
You don't know what you want --
I wanted this to be a date.
I have to get you home by one.
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
You're sometimes not sure?
Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
Maybe you're not supposed to.
No. Why? Are you seducible?
Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --
Pull over.
Better. I was really angry.
No. I want what's best for you.
That won't be possible.
I don't want to see her hurt.
Your parents are divorced?
Yes. You?
I'm no dummy.
That's right.  The world is your oyster.
I'm as underprivileged as they are --
Then you remember more than I do.
Where did you get -- ?
You came here to give me my report card?
Yeah.
A similar triangle?
Marty. What's for breakfast?
I don't know. National Cash Register?
Fine.
Oh yeah.
Uh, thanks...
Poly-what?
Have we ever met before?
Uh, hi....
You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
Coming, Eileen...
No!
Not now....
Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
I'm going to be at the dance.
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
What?
Five cents, please.
Operator, what's today's date?
What year?
Yeah,  Right.
Pro! Release the rope!
Shhhhhhhh!
Oh, right, right... 
...To be traveled through
Why?
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
It'll be fine, Marty.  You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
What do you call this? 
The Orpheum.
What? 
Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
Hi, Marty!
Well, he's gone.
What's going on?
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
Yeah.
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
Well, it's not good enough.  Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
What?
I know.
I don't care.
How bad off is he?
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
You said that once already... Too late now.
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
He didn't say anything to me about it.
Positive?
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
I just don't want to go.
Yeah.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Just thinking.
It's mine all right.
Hold it right there.
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
Not really.  This is pretty important.
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else?
Don't shoot!
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
Pretty terrible shot.
Who?
You don't wanna know.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
Penny--?!  Are you all right?
You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.
A what?
John Whorfin will kill us!
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
Why me?
No!  Ditto the professor-
Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. –I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.
...I know this must look... funny.
Really?...
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
Hello.
Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
What are they like? What are they about?
Before Bill came to Hollywood.
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
Hah!
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
...Who is this?
All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink?
It's still a little early for me.
And what would that be, son?
Ever act?
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
Who?
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
Well I...
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started–
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland – I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game – door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies – though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
Hell, I could tell you some stories–
See you, Charlie.
Nope.
Yeah.
But I didn't do it – don't you believe me?
Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
That's okay, that's okay, that's okay – that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay.  The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing – although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?
Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...
CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings – well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town – but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things – if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool – unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.
You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was – well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
No kidding, bright boy – we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
...Fred...
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it.  He'll get into the swing of things or I don't know writers. Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink I'm assuming you have it in spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. We're off to a good start. Dammit, if all our writers were like you I wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
This man creates for a living! He puts food on your table and on mine! THANK him for it!  Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU'RE fired!
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi.
She was there, wasn't she?
It's not gonna take long, Sam.
It's bullshit.  You know it is.
Nilsen.
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
You saw all the reports, Beth!
Put your hands up!
I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
What?
I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.
I don't smoke.
I found some in my purse; would you like one?
It won't last.
No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.
I loved him.  I hurt.
It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
You know all about me.
I'd like to ask you some, too.
There's a name from the past.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
Don't get too cocky.
What do you want from me, Catherine?
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
No.
To see if I can get away with it.
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
I'll meet you there.
Do you want her to join us sometime?
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
Why?
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
I don't know.
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
Of course I knew.
No.
Really.  What are you writing about.
It won't sell.
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
No.
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
Yes I am.
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
Routine.
Do you remember his name?
Nilsen?
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
The usual -- a girlfriend.
I hope I helped you out.
What is it you got between you?
I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
Why the hell not?
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  The razor just happened to be there.
What was it?
You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
How you're saying she killed her parents?  Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
You don't but it, do you?  She knew nobody would but it.  She knew I'd say she did it.  And she knew nobody would buy it.
I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
Can you check again?
No. Should I have?
I don't know.
Let's get out of here.
It's in New Jersey.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
Yeah, I met her already.
I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
Sure.
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
How do you know?
That's the same guy who did this painting.
Decipher?
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
Very well.
Out?
Still not here.
Yeah..
Use your fucking instinct.
Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.
Willie Mays.
SAMO.
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
Thanks.  Your dad called again – something about a job.
I am... On Gina.  Fuck – I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
I guess you did.
A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
Basquiat, what did you take?
You mean babies with you?
Hi.
A present I picked up for you.
Yeah, it's the best one.
You like your dad's paintings?
Wanna Mac?
Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
Yeah.
I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
I will relay the message.
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
You'll never guess.
Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
"Shreck's."  You --
We do.
I tried to grab you -- save you --
Yes and no ...
Yes and no...
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
Scared of Oswald, are you?  Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog!
The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...
Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...
Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
You came to tuck me in.  That's quite a switch.  I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore.  But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
Too late for what, dear child?
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.
Yes?
Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
Right here, sir.
What are you talking about?
What exactly are you doing?
We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.
I didn't kill your wife.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
From the other side of the equator-
Dr. Pamela Isley.
I see you knew him.
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
Can I get some help over here?
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
I wish I knew.
Bruce?  What are you doing?
Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
But he's never said a word-
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
OK, OK.  Ms. Ivy to the rescue.  Now where do I find your brittle bride?
Where is my wife?
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
Then you never loved me?
Sorry to disappoint you.  But rubber lips are immune to your charms.
Well, I can respect your opinion.
I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
Why, indeed?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
What?
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
What?
I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
Fred?
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?
Here. Get a good seat.
Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.
Don't bogart that 'trode.
Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours.  Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
I know. I called them.
I won't let you have it.
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
Photo database. I'll do your photos now.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
What is it you want?
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
I feel naked without it.
The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
What now?
Take 'em! I want his head!
WHAT?
WHAT??
They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
What are you talking about?
No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --
Because I want someone I can trust.
Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
What were you thinking?
Well, he must like the way he looks.  He's got a mirror in every room.
Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
Oh, Bruce...
Yeah. Deja vu.
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
I said I'd check with you.
I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it.  Stupid thing.
Now what does that mean?  My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing?  That tie's God-awful.  Why do you wear it?
Yes.  Great.  Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company.
Right first time.
Thanks, Annie.
Uh ... yes ...
Ahm.....
Ahm.... .
Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.
She's ... well, she's good.
Yes, isn't he.
Isn't it?
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
Great - keep him out of trouble.
Thank you Bernie.  Well done.  Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.
Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
Er ... pray tell me why?
... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.
Ahm....
And a car.
Sean Connery.
Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
Yes?
I am sorry you feel that way.
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all gonna die!
Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.
Yeah, we should party.
What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find that chick.
Me first?
My butt's bothering me!
Uh, probably like, another five minutes or something.
Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my life is like, flashing in front of my eyes!
Butt-dumpling...
Dill-wad...
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
Yeah, we're gonna score.
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
I see it. I don't get it.
Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
That's better. Yes?
Where did these guys come from?
Agent Hurley...
Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
Yoo-hoo! Travis and Bob Head. Whoo-hoo!
Yup. Huh huh.
Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
No, Jane.
We're rich in what really matters.
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
That's my girl!
You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
That's all we need.
We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
Little black party dresses?
What makes you think she likes me?
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
Is this like a trick question?
We were trying to scare your mother.
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
Really.  I don't know.
I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.
Can you scare them off?
Now, let's get rolling!
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
Yes.
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
No.  You don't want his help.
Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
No, Lydia, we're dead.
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
And live in what, our station wagon?
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
That's it!
Just <u>say</u> it.
... I will.
It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.
There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too.  I saw a fly today.
Not these people!  They are ruthless!
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
Let me have it.
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
I don't know.
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
I'll need something personal of theirs.
Yes, I will.
It's fine today, Robert.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
Stay here? Is that necessary?
Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Yes, sir.
Your family doctor?
Yes. Thank you.
No. I'm a gardener.
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
No. I like it here.
Hello, Eve.
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
No, thank you.
Yes, Eve. I know that.
The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
Yes, I agree, I think so too.
We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Oh, good.
Yes. You look very sick.
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
I understand.
Thank you, Ben.  ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.
Yes, Ben - he is.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
Yes. I like to watch very much.
I want to tell Eve.
I can't write.
What sort of bed is it?
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
Oh. Thank you.
Yes. Of men and women.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
I agree.
I've never ridden in an automobile.
Yes sir. I'll take care of that.
How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
Is his back feeling better?
I'm going to work in the garden.
I hope so.
Yes, Thomas - I understand.
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
I see...
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
Try again.
Try again.
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?
... Yes, I am, Ben.
... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much.  ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
Right, Chief.
No, sir.
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
Take care of yourself, Ben.
This is my fiancee Maxine.
Oh yeah, he's good.
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
We'll talk about it in the car.
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
What's that?
Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
Yes?
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain “doors” which should never be opened.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
The usual, Barry.
My tits?
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.  Not a chance.
Well, I'm a puppeteer...
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
My God.
Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.
Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Fork ah did?
Why not? I need to get in there!
After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it.  Psychotherapy.
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
Whatever you're having.
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
It's okay, my sweet.
I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
What want ye, girl child?
But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
Folks come. Folks go.
No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
At times. At other times I think she was...more. But who would know that better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough you her.
I will.
May I come in?
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
Yes ma'am.
Don't matter. First time I'll be late in nine years. No great trouble..Whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time... don't matter...  The world is in this room, baby. This is all there is and all there needs to be.
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
Better ask Paul D.
He's sleeping in the church.
He ask, I give him anything.
You was friends.
For what?
Paul D.
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
She was my best thing.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
What do you think?
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
Oh, nothin', you know.
Uh-huh.
Oh, man, don't say that..
Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
Yeah, it sucks.
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
Come and get it.
Show me what you got.  Nihilist. Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.
Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
My rug.
Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.
Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean look at it.  Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  She owes money all over town--
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
I got eighteen dollars, Dude.
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!
They were Nazis, Dude?
Well--
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is--are you ready for this?-- Arthur Digby Sellers.
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--
That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!
Uh-huh.
Lebowski on the right?
Far out.
Color?
Yeah.  Thanks man.
Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.
What's your drink, Dude?
Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude.  Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.
Yeah man.
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
--your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.
Now I got--
I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
Do you still have that doctor's number?
Delayed after-eff--
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
Okay. That, uh.
Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--
Huh?
Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!
MARK IT ZERO!
No, you're not wrong--
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
What the fuck is going on there?
Easy, Dude.
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
The nail polish, Walter.
Now Dude--
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
The bulk of the series.
Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny.
Look, man, did you--
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
Dude?
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
Uh-huh.
Hey, cool it Walter.
No Dude.
Wha. . . Donny--
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
Dude, I'm sorry--
Yeah?
You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch you.
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.
No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
Help me put him back in his chair.
Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
Impressive.
We'll take 'em in the morning.
Nothing.
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
Fry 'em.
Either that or feeding the worms.
These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
I'll show you.
We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Not alone.
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
Getting your attention, Paco.
Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.
You experimented on your own, son?
Two so far.
No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
Us?  What are you talking about?
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
Are we bringing home strays now?
Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
How can you be out here?
You're wrong.
You're blind --
Who is LaMagra?
But I just got here --
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
Preventive medicine.
He will.
Some kind of archive --
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
Blade --
I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
I'm not leaving without you.
You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.
Then what is it?
What about the chemistry panel?
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
No problem.
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
Someone who's sick of living off scraps. The coming age belongs to us, not the humans!  When the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?
The other elders will never let you get away with this!
Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.
My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --
Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
We weren't sure we could trust you.
No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
--which she may have--
Join the club.
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
Yes.
To stand up--I'm exhausted. Been on the road since yesterday.
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
That's a joke?
It's like traveling back in time.
She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
What?
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
You feel no need to get married or anything.
--fine, later, fine.
I don't know. Nightmare.
--bullshit!
Get your goddamn--
--Cotter's--
No.
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
Whatever you want.
Why?
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
I can't.
Both. Now.
Sometimes.
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
Turn the tapes back on.
Hey, Mr. Graduate Fucking Thesis here was s'posed to be driving!
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
No.
What're you, nuts?
I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.
<u>What</u>--
--before you lose your emotional lunch.
--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
Fine.
<u>Now</u> you can bring the vehicle to a stop: there on the left.
--now there.
Due for a re-load and battery check. I'll get on it.
--great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!
--oh, Jesus--
No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
I think it's time to get out of here.
I can't!
Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
No. I don't think so.
--no.
That's why she kills children.
--she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil--
She's off her fucking rocker--
That feels good. Lower--down into my neck.
Hey, chemicals, fear, sleep- deprivation--and a round-the-clock obsession with the occult--hell've a recipe for a mind-fuck.
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning.
What happened to my Dad??
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
What?
If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch?
Door's locked. Nothing there.
Yeah? What happened?
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
I said you're bad.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right...
You owe me for two weeks.
How long did you watch her?
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
For the money.
Got something to show me first?
Of course.
Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
What's the point?
Meurice...
What?
No. I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
Yeah.
Nobody.
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
No. Come on.
See my nipples?
Yeah. hurry up though.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.
Sometimes I think I do.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.
Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Oh God, Jeffrey. is that you? Oh God.
They hurt his head.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
What?
Nothing.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
That's too bad.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Why not?
I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.
Okay, Sandy.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
Really. you want to dance with someone else?
No.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Yeah.
That sounds great!
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
What?  Yeah, sure.
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
You're a fucking amateur!
I see.  How much?
No.
It's your grass.
It's your grass.
It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting.
Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
Yeah.  She told me.
For calling you a homo.
No fucking way.
Oh hey, one more thing?
Not really, no.
Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
I would if I could get some sleep.
Because they caught me?
Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
Try the closet.
I love you too, man.
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream?
You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
Oh, I see.
Look at this credenza.  If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  It's got to cost a fortune.
Actually, it was three.
Yes, it is.
It's beautiful.
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
Family.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
I'm going to California.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft...
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
That was a good one, Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that?
That was a beautiful message.
No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong fucking guy.  I'm not a rat.
Figured what out?
Tuna.
I don't think so.
Why are you smiling?
Out.
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
I know.  Well, that's all I really wanted to say.  So, okay, then.
George, he wasn't asking.
Are we gonna split up?
You can call me Dad if you want.
Yeah.
You swear?
But I've got school.
Swear on my life.
I know, Dad.  I know...
Okay, George.
We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's lockdown time.
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
Who speaks Spanish?
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
Dien Bien Phu?
I understand. What's your question?
And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
Sid Ahmed.
Sail.
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
Sure. By shooting at me.
No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
Sure ...
Let's try ...
Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
Good evening, sir.
Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier.
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
Thanks, Mister D.
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
What'd he die of?
But there's more?
A massive cardiac arrest.
No.
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
Back off, John.
I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over.
Her.  It's an obvious move.  I'm building a case against her, remember?
Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months.  I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
No.
I assume his girlfriend.
Rebecca Lawson.
No -- but I can get it for you.
No -- never.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Yes.
Yeah.
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
For about one year.
It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control.  She always used to tell me it had to be her way.
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
Cocaine.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
I was angry.
That's enough.
No.
Oriental medicine.
She suffers from severe menstrual cramps.
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
No.
Then -- those are not your own words?
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
Yes -- he did.
I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
I was at the house one morning -- I thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial.
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
Yes.
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
Because he called me.
And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
You still haven't answered my question.
No pain, no gain?
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
Hi.  It's Frank.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
What would?
What?
I went out on the boat.
Paley could be a problem tomorrow.
I do need you.  No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
Is Mom yelling at you too?
Why?
-- But it's Sunday.
No, Your Honor.
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
I'll talk to him later.
Where have you been?
No.
I don't want our lives ruined because of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want this to work -- but you have to help me.  You have to come back from where ever it is you are.
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
We were here two Christmases ago.
It's not that long.
SO!
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
Why are there two deeds here?
I know. I don't understand it either.
Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
'82.
This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
Yeah. But I thought she died.
I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
Heat is heat.
Yeah.
Hmm-mmm.
After the divorce.
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
I found this Chicago station before. Wait a minute...  Here it is.
Want another cigarette?
Not at all.
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
Much.
But I... We don't even know each other.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband.
Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.
No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
You want to go back in?
Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.
No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
No.
No. But I love them just the same.
What made you ask such a question?
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
Yes! Hi.
No. I was just... No.
Wonderful. Uh...
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
I want you to come.
Oh, how is he?
Couple. Want to help?
Have you ever been to that station?
Why?
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
Because I already tried once.
I had a temper.
No.
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
I can't sleep.
I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
Frannie.
I'm going to miss you.
What's she like?
Cremated?!
WHAT!
It's the only way.  It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
How the hell should I know?
Yeah?
Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
What the hell you talking about?
Damn.  It's so...fresh.
I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
What it will be.
It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
Just try it.
Go on.  It won't kill you.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
Don't you worry about a thing.  This hand's gonna be stroking the back of your neck tonight.
I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
Since we was just grasshoppers...
You mean as opposed to your life?
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
Okay, okay.  Listen:
I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
Fuck it.  Alright.
A little business move I made.  On my own.  I think you're gonna approve.
Dad?
Daddy?
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
Get that car the hell away from here, now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
Look, you guys want to play college radio, high school reunions, and some fool's club once a week for the rest of your lives, that's cool.  But I think we can do better.
I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.
Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  It leaked and stained.
No thanks.
That building?
Should I?
Save him?  What are you talking about?
But the place burned to the ground.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
What's that, Johnnie?
The same way you did before.
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
You aim a gun at me?!  Do you know who I am?!  I am Gino Marzzone.  You understand?
Why?  'Cause you know him?
I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
All right, Caesar.
This is insane!
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
I had to.  You made me.
Sure, Gino, sure.
Go right ahead, sir.
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
Are you okay, Violet?
Oh yeah.  Violet!
Leave your phone on the hook.
This is the police, ma'am.
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
You're doing everything yourself?
Truck.  Of course.
I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
The redistribution of wealth?
I'm not afraid of anything.
I suppose he just wants to watch.
What choice?
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
You think I'm lying?
Yeah.
To let it dry.
Does the case lock?
Like each other?  They hate each other.
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Poor boy, has to work so hard.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
If he does ...
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
Hey.
Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
I don't know what we're talking about.
Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
I'm not asking.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
What do you want to do?
We're in the shitter, man!  Pick your poison.  Maybe he's in there to finish the job.  Maybe he's working for Wombosi.  Maybe they want to go on TV together.  Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!
<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
...it's a problem...
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
Jason...  They can't let you go...
Who?  Who came?
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is -- 
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
I know that.
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
I can't believe I slept.
I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke.
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
Go ahead.
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
...omigod, no...
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
-- there's no time --
Who paid the bill?
Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
What?
xxxxxx
Hang on... 
Enhance it.
Abbott wants to talk.
I tried.
Where am I?
I don't remember Zurich.
Uh - what? - I ...
What have you done to my flat?
...sabotage!
... ere please.
It's reply paid.
You don't have to sing it.
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
You remember Alison?
Not much.
I'm sure you have
Shut up!
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
Oh.
Them?
What?
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
A heavy Christmas present.
Well, no system is.
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Oh God! What have we done?
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
"And your children all gone."
"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
Don't worry.
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
27156789/074328/K.
Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
Here.
What's the matter?
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
This is your dream girl, is it?
Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. 
I won't be held responsible.
A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?
I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was very close -
Mother!
Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Um ...
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
I ... uh ...
Numero trois, steak.  Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
Monsieur. Quel numero.
Numero, trois.
Madam ... CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
Who fixed your ducts?
Are you saying this is illegal?
Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
No. Wait here.
On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.
I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
She say she in great pain.
Mary ...
He looks like a cop.
Sleeping in the back.
No!
What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
I can't. I have to stay with my patient.
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
I know him. That's Noel.
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
Yes.
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
Okay.
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
You asked me not to come.
Fifteen minutes.
Because you can barely walk.
Frank.
The ghosts--
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
She's no whore, Marcus.
What look?
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
How can that be? He was getting better.
Yes.
Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
I've taken that into consideration.
Frank!
I'm not hungry.
Used to be my partner.
You sure?
No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
You've made my dreams silly.
I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
And the rule was...
We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind.  What are they?
There are only ten.
Oh, God, no!
The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
I'll put her on.
No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.
Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?
Are you any closer to a decision?
Why?
Yes.
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
Why do you say that?
Sure.
Eleven and a half.
Not because you have to.
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
You too.
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
Define your terms.
No.
I lost six pounds...
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
No!!!!!
Yes, I guess.  Yes.
No.  You know that I'm not.
Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.  How do you like that? -- I buried the lead.
Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you.  Just on superficial performance things.
They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
So I quit.
Oh, come on -- tell us another.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
I liked it.  He's not afraid to be human.
Yes?
No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
We could...
Right there, Bobbie.
One's enough.
Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.
Nobody else had it.
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
Okay, sweetie.
Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
No.  Not even you.
It's not.
Fill for a second.
That actually goes on...
How are you at back rubs?
We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
Billion.
Excited.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
Well, what is it?
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
I'll see you at the office.  Good night.
Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night.
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
Then you should stay here.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
Uh-huh.
I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
I didn't finish talking to you!
Oh it's enough...
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
Honest?
Yeah it was all just an accident.
Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
Carla...
Yeah.  Can some of you guys help me?
Here here...
I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
Why not?!
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
Is it?  I've forgotten.
Leonard, what are you doing?
I'm totally serious!
Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along?
Don't ask.
I do the research.
I know, man.
I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
Man if this place doesn't cool out I'm gonna hang out somewhere else...
Didn't you hear him?
Yeah, right outside the door!
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
What is it, your laundry?
I said I did, didn't I!
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
What, Mr. De Santis?
I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
Just wait till you see this!
I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
Yeah I did.
You're like an undercover guy!
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Yes, get rid of them...
Did you like it Mister Brock?
Uh, I don't know.
I thought you didn't respect money!
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
What's the matter with you!
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
Let me in.
You look like shit, Benny.
I mean it.
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Yeah, I guess.
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
Yeah?
I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
You were having a nightmare.
Nothing.
Jealous?
I do?  I guess I do.
Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
Water.  Okay.
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
I know.
Merrick...
I should have known.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
Where?
Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
To bring you... your birthright.
You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
Wait!
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
This is it.
All right.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
We'll cover it later.
We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
Oh.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
Buffy...
I can't work this.
I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
And where are they now?
Cassandra's really smart.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Thanks.
Really?
I don't understand.
Okay, what else?
Oh, baby!
I heard she got straight A's.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
Okay.
Buffy?
Nee sitch.  No way.
Okay.
Right!
Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?
Nuke?!
Get over here.
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--
No, no, it was great.
I know what it is.
What a nasty thing to say.
I'll be back when we lose.
So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk--
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
What do you believe in?
That's my job too.
Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
You got me all confused.
I'm not a real batter.  I'm a woman.
It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
No.
There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
You'd be great, just great...  'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an'  all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it...
I can do that, too.
He looks great, just great!
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
We gonna fuck or what?
C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
Beg me again!
Well, I held it like an egg.
I'm having a blast.  God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
You been in the Majors?
Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
Learn your cliches.  Study them. Know them.  They're your friends.
Jesus.
I'm nervous--my old man's here.
Let go of me!
God damn it, you fucking virgin prick--step outside.
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
My right.
You too...Meat.
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
It's a damn easy thing to play with.
Can I give you my testimony?
We're getting married.
Ain't he warning up?
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
We're eight and sixteen.
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
Where does he go?
What?
I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
Was I at that dinner?
I was in the building!
It's a pity in this...
What do you propose?
Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I -
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
Speeding?
You fuckin' piece of shit.
I can't! I'm tied!
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
I don't know.
Hey.
Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah, right, I'm sure.
It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
Four aces, Doc.
You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
I'm sorry about this. Really.
Between...
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
In so many words, yes.
Listen...
Hey.
What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.
I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
Yeah.
I lost control?
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
It's none of my business?
Practice enough this week, you prick?
Why?
I -
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
And what'd she want?
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
Sammy.
No, I'm not okay.
Well...
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.
I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
Well, that's why they paid so well.
Seven o'clock.
Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
No. Just stop everything.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
I'm not crying. 
Yeah.
Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her.
...they didn't know what really moved her.
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
What? What?!
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here.  I am.
Okay, okay.
No, you don't.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
With what?
Mm-hm.
But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
I'll get your cash. You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you! You never loved me in the first place!  I need eyes in the back of my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin' bitch!
You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
And where'd you go?
You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
You want your jewelry?
Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
I am calm!
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
Eight children! 
Mr Rothstein.
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
Green?
I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
Can't do it with both hands?
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Yeah?
Thanks, Nick.
Shut your mouth!
Well, I've been busy. 
Sam?
Hey.
Jeff, would you go in with her?
Go get a bag, man.
...fuckin' jerk-off.
If we let her get a few of her things we'll be out of your hair.
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Yeah?
Here we go!
Nicky, I did -
...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
Is that the last one?
Great!
Carmine's gone.
For what?
How are you?
I'll take care of it, Remo.
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
Hm.
He's good. He's fine.
I understand.
Yeah.
Want me to take this for you? 
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
I do.
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
All right?
You're so nice. 
Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
Okay.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
Is that what you want?
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
All right. Be careful.
Thank you. Very nice.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
Come on! 
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
Okay, then.
Lester - he called you here.
Are they out now?
Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live with her.
Hold it, hold it. Here.
You jag-off.
Get up.
What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
Pleasure.
Remo.
But he never talked.
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
So are we.
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
Oh, he ain't nobody.
They'll do it.
Fuck you!
You sure?
Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony.
Oh, sorry -
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
All right, all right. But I - I -
It's okay. Let her go.
Guilty. I am.
I don't know. I can't remember.
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going...
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?
Winning.
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
Why am I still troubled...
How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.
Absolutely.
A bit sadistic, don't you think, Captain...?
Of course it matters!  It throws off everything!  "Superhero" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood!  Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy, my comrade-- women aren't buddies, women aren't warriors!  You tried to turn the Cult of Good into some after-work softball team!  It's time to get thrown from the treehouse...
And...your point?
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
I actually got some memory back last night.
Enough.
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
What?
I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine...
Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
Trust me, you won't have to.
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
This is one way.
Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.  Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen.  Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice.  We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
Then whose is it?
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
Can you make him stop!
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
Bullshit.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
What do you keep making me out to be?
I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
Will you let me explain!
Because you know you'll be killing us.
Then hang up!  Do it!
They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
No -- nothing.
Shit!
He's right?  Look, don't try to put blood on my hands.  You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
And that was the end of it?
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
That's not her.
No.
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
The City National on San Vincente.
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
Your husband?
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
L.A.P.D.
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
Do you have to point that?
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
Stop talking like that!
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
259-7881.
I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
Why are we stopping?
We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
Naturally.
That's not good enough.
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
You're up on your details, aren't you?
Keep talking.
We don't see you.
You'll see her.
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
Call me "Nels."
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
There's two police cars now.
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
How do you know?
Nobody can do anything right but you!
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Thanks.
Then why doesn't she?
What would you call it?
It's him, isn't it?
Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
She's not that either.
Bloody right I do...
In a way.
No.
Like treacle.
They all get the wrong idea.
You know.
Where?
Must be.
Must be in love to manage that.
Yes...
Maybe.
Want to look after you.
Where?
I said stop it.
I know that.
Make it up to me, then.
When?
Sorry.
Stop it, Jimmy.
Yes.
Afraid so.
I promise.
What?
For me.
I was trying to get out of something.
You mean that?
My pills...
You knew which man?
In a manner of speaking.
No.
Yes.
Yeah.
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
Yes. Say hello to Col --
That's wise, Tommy.
Need to go across the water.
Do you want some food?
Someone's got to do it.
Leave me alone, Jude.
No, what is the thing?
No way, Jude. I'm out.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight --
Just a girl.
Right.
Can't eat through a canvas bag.
So, what do I look like?
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
You want to bet?
Not in your nature.
And you know the funny thing?
She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
You could have said no.
Shouldn't take it personally.
How different?
Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you?
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
Don't be so sure.
Like what?
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
I've often wondered how you do it.
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out. Tell her I was thinking of her.
Stop it --
Me? No, I'm not good for much...
You won't run.
What you say, faster?
You didn't?
He's a good soldier, Jude.
That true, Fergus? You in love?
Where are you, ol' buddy?
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
How was I leading you on?
I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
Open up.
Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
No -- last time I said "I love you, Alex."
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
I know, but this is all we've got left.
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
We? You mean you're --?
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
Agent.
May I have a sandwich, please?
So that was it.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
But --
Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
No.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
The last one, please.
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
Brian.
Yes.
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
You'll wreck your raincoat.
The view had better be worth it.
You're out, Dyle -- right now!
But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
It's all right with us --
No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Okay.
You did.
Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I.
Tuesday.
I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
Maybe.
A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
I'm sorry.
Alex --
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
What do you mean?
What's its value today?
Here's ten.
And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy --
Not unless we're blind.
But his mother --
I don't know.
I don't know.
I know.  I'm sorry.
A letter? May I see it?
And this?
Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie!
No, Jean-Louis.
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
How do you shave in there?
How about once more around the park?
What?
There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
A quarter of a million dollars.
That's all.
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
No -- no, I'm don't.
Please stop -- please!
Ça alors! From Charles?
Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
We will separate -- you look over there.
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
I never fucked Rod.
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
Daddy you scared me!
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
How much further?
You are upset.
Are you sure?
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
She works at a church?
No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant.
Who's?
What?
Really?
Who?
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
Does she fuck?
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
OK. increase the peace.
The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
Stag?
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
I do not.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
That's not why we broke up.
Sharon's far from a slut.
Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.
What?
Yeah. Who is she?
Hi Sandy.
They're tasty.
So are you.
I'm not leaving it here.
Told you to hide it.
But you don't really mean it.
INT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.
INT. ANDY'S ICE CREAM FACTORY/STAIRWELL - DAY.
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY.
...-ty.
Art.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.

 No.
...and a shitload of ice.
I got, like, uh....
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
No.

What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
You'd better coast through...
Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone.
Am I missing somethin' here?
You stole this truck.


Oh...
Kiss my ass!
...-cho and a hijack-...
...truck!
Well, then, that means it's call...


Oh, shit.
Goddamn!
God, man!
 Oh...
...Night Shift, but you might...
...you crazy bastard.
You okay?
 Oh...

I'm a dangerous man!
Oh, shit.  Okay.  Come on.
What?


What?
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
We got two paddles.
...split.
I think you oughta cut a...
Even though it is nice to see Andy...
Bring him down!
Are you all right?



Reach into my pocket.
 Come on!
Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.



Go, go, go! 
What?
Whoo!
What do you think I'm doin'?!




Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
Who drove the ice cream...
Thank you.
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
Yeah.
Yeah.
 big balls.
Don't be tedious, waiter.  Dr. Long called it Elvis.
Three seconds.  One...

I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy.  But I can tell you this.  Takin' your truck pissed you off?
...help you?
Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.
Thank you.
However, you are also non-en-...
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
But you have no choice but to follow orders.
You have my word on that.
No!
Is this stool taken?
You look good, Richard.
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
...you were right, of course.  But after...
Almost quaint.
And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.
All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.
INT. U.S. RESEARCH LABORATORY/LONG'S OFFICE - NIGHT.
EXT. BRYNNER'S VAN - NIGHT.
INT. DARLENE'S STORE - DAY.
INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAY.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY
Check the immediate area.
...-ther orders?
You can't fire on them.  You're gonna detonate the crystals.
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn.  Take these two behind the van.
We're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
We were called in by the Jerome base...
...-fall.
...screwup?
...noon.
They'll get a break tomorrow.
Mornin'.
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
...Long.
Odd, then, that his car...
It's a little late for matinee heroics, Mason.  Just give me the con-...
Where's Arlo?
Your fellow hero, untouched...
...-spite the mouth.



You'd never understand!
Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
I can handle it.
Secrets.
His I know.  Yours I don't have a clue.  But if it wasn't for you, I think he'd have drifted right on through this town.
You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene.
You got thirty minutes.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY. 
What's going on, colonel?
It must've happened right after we left.
...-son.

...try this one out some-...
 ...or it'll ignite. 
Everything will die, Mason.
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
...-lem?
Got that?
Yeah, asshole.  I'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who...

You sure?
All right, go.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
He must've had a damn arsenal in there.
Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
I think I gave it to her.
Who's the investigating officer?
Do you know him?
Where from?
Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
No. She's probably scared to death.
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
She's fine.
With her mother.
Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
I think I'll kill her.
You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Plus what I owe you?
You sure this is okay?
Okay.
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
The apple core club.
No.
No?
How did she...  ...happen to have them?
What pictures?
Yeah?
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
C'mon I'll show you.
Shut up.  Go on.
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
Do you know where she might be?
Yes.
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
Yeah. Fine, thank you.
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Oh... thank you.
A check?
I have?
It wasn't much of a lie.
Did he know?
Where you were when your husband died.
No reason.
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
No.
They can't be.
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
What were you doing there?
Doing what?
Your eye.
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
Just... I have to.
That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
How about a plane?
Where can we go?
He's in the dark room.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
Ida Sessions.
Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.
Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
Oh, good.
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Yes?
Drowned, too.
It's not completely dry.
Who?
Sure you do.
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Yeah.
He's not in, Mr.?
Yes. No.
He owned it.
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
Yeah.
They're all a bunch of phonies.
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film. 
But you don't have any kids!!!
No...
Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 
It tastes wonderful!
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Progress! It always arrives too late!
That's right, Modern Times.
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
Elena. My name's Elena.
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
For what?
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
What the fuck you talking about? You getting into the act too, Toto? Titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and I have to say thanks! If I ask for two, the least they'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it!
OK...
Ready for dinner, Brad?
Oh!
From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
Enthusiastic?
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
Certainly not.
Yes.
Yes.
Mr. Kane is finishing it.
Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
Yes - Mr. Kane.
Has he said when he'll finish?
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
Of course.
Charles!  Your - your breaking this man's neck -  would scarcely explain this note -  Serious consequences for Mr. Kane -  for myself, and for my son.  What does this note mean, Miss -
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -
Too late for what?  Too late for you and this -  this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me?  Well, you won't do it, I tell you.  You won't do it!
Hmm!
You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
You're no Venus de Milo.
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
No.  But you're close.
Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!
Don't you worry about me.  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
It's a good idea for a newspaper.  Four hundred sixy thousand.
How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
Good.
Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor.  What do you think that crowd is doing down there?  They think you murdered him.
Charlie!
She's going to leave you -
Yes.
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
It's a letter from her lawyers.
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
All we saw on that screen was a big American -
Yes, sir.
Queer?
Millions - if anybody wants it.
Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -
Rosebud?
Am I sure?
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
How long have you been a smoker?
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
I take it she likes the guy.
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
There's no light back there.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
Awww. That was so cute.
Dante. You've got a customer.
I can't believe you're here.
Very dramatic, I thought.
So you're really getting married?
How like her.
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
You lie.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
I hear that's a rather popular date.
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
It wasn't me.
Oh God...
What time was this?
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
Yes.
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
So I'm told.
Are you open?
Peptic ulcer.
Yeah.
Oooh! Navy Seals!
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
Bunch of savages in this town.
No, thanks.
She called you Brad?
What do you mean?
That girl was vile to you.
Chess team Allan Harris?!
You know what I just watched?
Blasphemy.
There's more?
So?
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
Can you believe this?!
FUCK!
Sorry.
At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
Can we not talk about this?
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
Yeah, right.
It's today.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
If you go, I go.
How'd he die?
Bible truth.
I swear.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
Yeah, but at what a price.
Reach what?
Listen to you.
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
I don't want to talk to you.
You work in a video store!
Exactly.
As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
I'm not. She just left.
I'm not.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.
Thanks.
Jesus.
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
What time did you get to work today?
Same time. What about you?
I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I know I can bench more than that!
Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
Excuse me?
See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
So.
We were going to start again, I think.
Veronica.
I'm trying.
I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
Uh, can I have the other one. The one below this one. They show more in that one.
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
I hate this fucking place.
Bunch of savages in this town.
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
You're a pig.
Three including you.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
Why do you say that?
I'm serious...
Um. Thirty-seven.
Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!
I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi, Randal.
...it isn't there. Yes.
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
What time do you get finished?
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
What?
Can I have your name please?
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
No way!
Because he's out of shape.
I like the way you think.
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
You're not?
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
More bang for the buck.
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
They're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, Gabe.
I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
You're getting warmer!
WHEN SHE'S SAFE!
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
Look, I know--
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
Is it really four thousand?
I'm here!  Sarah, I'm here!  I'm here--I've got you!
The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.
On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
Why are you yelling?
Why are you yelling?
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
Hal knows what he's doing.
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
Can't do it.
Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
Want me to lead?
If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
Up ahead.
Forget it.  If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us.  This way.
That's exactly what I want you to do.
Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind.
The best he can since you gave him nothing.
We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
There is.
Tucker and Walker.
Then it's a deal.
On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
There, what's that place?
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.
The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.
And you, sir?
No. She's dead!
Phoned some friends, sir?
Who are they, sir?
Julian. This will be these people now. Alex gets up.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
Sorry, Em, I wanted it to be like... a big surprise for you and pee.
A cup of the old chai, sir?
Just a manner of speech, sir.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
No, sir, I feel really great.
Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
Keeping fit then?
Oh, aye, aye.
Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what he is... he... he rents your room. Alex confronts Joe.
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
And, O my brothers, would you believe your faithful friend and long suffering narrator pushed out his red yahzik a mile and a half to lick the grahzny, vonny boots. The horrible killing sickness had wooshed up and turned the like joy of battle into a feeling I was going to snuff it. Minister rises.
Murder, sir.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
C of E, sir.
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
How're you feeling this morning?
Vitamins will it be then?
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
I just say what the other person would say?
Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
I'm sure it won't be long now.
You're not cured yet, my boy.
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
This is to make sure you stay cured. Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their blackjacks. After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,
Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be.
Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.
Four in this block, sir.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
You got a deal.
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
Travel...and things.
You psychic?
Max...
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
Yes.
Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
I'm sorry.
Can't say that I do.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Twenty five?
Very generous.
Pretty quiet down there.  A cab just pulled up, aside from that...
So?
No.  Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.
What thing?
Oh, call me Ida.  To what do we owe the pleasure?
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
Of course I'm proud.  You know he started with nothing?  Look at him today.  Playing concerts.
By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
What happens if you don't?
Who the hell is this?
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
Max!  Dammit!  <u>Answer!</u>
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
Oh.  Sorry.
Yeah, yeah, sorry...
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
Two, two-fifty.
No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.
I don't think I can do this.
...and you promise you'll never tell anybody about this, right?  Get in the fucking car.
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
South Central.
They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.
Tonight it is.
Yes.
Play music.
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
How?
Lenny, my dispatcher.
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
I need the job.
I don't understand...
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?
You'd do her a favor.
What happened?
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
Dmitri?
We've both run out of options.  If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.
Who?
I don't know.
No, not just that.
One more.
That's what you said...
What'd they do?
That's the reason?
Answer the question.
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
Let her go.
Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
Drop me off here!
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
I gotta go, Flip.  Thanks.
Shut the hell up.
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
Not testing.  <u>Using</u>.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.
Do you still ride?
No.
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
You bit someone's nose off?
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
Arf... You gotta help me.
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
Nothing is easy.
Six months.  Eleven days.
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
Flesh wound.  No big deal.
This would be it?
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
Can you prove any of this?
Never, but I've been practicing.
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
Is this your dad?
How'd he die?
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
Realized what?
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
Right here in Manhattan.
Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
If that's what you want.  Yes.
What?
Jerry, I --
Now's not really the time to get into this --
There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
Not today.
This way.
Where are we going, Jerry?
What's in Connecticut?
Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
Come on.
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
Because he believed me.
You saw me standing alone ...
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own.  Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
The truth shall make you free.
Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.
Yes, that's right.
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
You do recognize it then?
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
Agent Lowry?
-- Understood.
Tell me about it.
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
I was just thinking that.
Nothing.  I was just making sure. So, who are you?
He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
Yes, sir.
How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
It's a hoax.  I knew it!
No doubt.
You can't just pull the plug, David.
David --
If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
Ellie.
As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
Good luck, David.
Thank you?
Well --
Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
Put it on speakers.
NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.
This is how you see the sky?
It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.
It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
Okay.
We thought this might make things a little easier.
Now... you go home.
Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
I do.  More than anything.  But I am also a realist.  Soon this... what is your charming term -- ?  Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home.
Actually --
-- I'm moving to Washington.
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
Wait -- hold on a minute --
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
Can you try?
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
It's getting late...
An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
I'll make it a dollar.
I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else.
Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
Yeah.
Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
I... I... I...
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
You jes' watch us!
Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
'Bout two hours left.
What happened? How far did you get?
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
Get away!
Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
I just always did like truck rides.
But damn if he don't look like a fat old Dragline.
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
We got it locked in the sock.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
Gettin' up, Carr.
I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
Damn.
That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
No. No chains either.
You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison.
Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
Hal has it.
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you really want her help.  I mean if you really do, leave them.  Let her see them.  I'll see they're safe...
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
I sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you?  That son of a gun...!
Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something <u>else</u> about you.
Is he out?
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
For months... last October.
How do you know that?
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown.  I'll drive you down...
Not yet.
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's phone.  I know you won't mention it.
Lieutenant  Quinn.
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
Classy madonna.
Let's get out of here...
Look at her legs.
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
Helen... excuse me, we...
Right.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
You got a suspect...
Or the F.B.I.?
"Spokes<u>person</u>."
We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate, the license approval for our air-charter firm. I forgot to tell you.
And her husband? What was he?
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
James.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.
Are you still involving me in your crash?
I can drive.
You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
I miss Beast a lot, too.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
Then that's even more reason to listen. Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes. 
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
And the party?
What about the engagement party?
Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
Do you think I should?
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
You've only known Jake a few months.
No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
Especially with a promotion in the offing.
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
A deal's a deal.
Don't be fresh.
Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
Green spot.
Lie?
It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
I'm not the one who's masquerading as a doctor. I'm not the one who's, who's...
I've already checked it out 17 times.
So are you engaged, or what?
Enough with the abracadabra.
The left one.
OK, OK, I'll give it back.
And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
Really?    Me too.
What are the delusions like?
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
Home free.
Not a one.
I better make a list.
Aren't you ever quiet?
Do you like it?
Really?
Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
No.
I'll be forced to tickle you.
Thanks.
That's Mr. Beast to you.
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
Are you OK?
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
It wasn't exactly a lie.
Michael, take it easy.
Well then why'd it happen?
I'm calling in sick.
That's a big question.
This has been really difficult, this whole thing. 
You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
So, what do you say, Let?
He's a patient here.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
Oh.
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
Do you know who this is?
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
They don't have a murder weapon?
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
Not today.   Where are your friends?
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
No thank you.
I'm not here to negotiate.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
Yes.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
I guess we're going to find out.
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
Where are you from?
And the Vodka.
What for?
We'll think of something.
No.
Do I?
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
Good idea.
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
Has to be.
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
Fine.     Ten o'clock.
Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
Okay boss.
Oh, I'm sorry.
The Holiday Hotel.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
I see.   A master criminal.
It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
Mr. Taylor?
God, I want to go home.
Get in the car.
Yeah.   It's mine.
The hell it is.
It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
Cool.
And you don't speak French?
Thanks.
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
Something like that.
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
Stick around and find out.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
It's for you.
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
I do as I please.
Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
I'm just playing around.
I'll never live as a thief!
Don't bother.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
You're probably right.
Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
Yes, from the West.  He went undercover and and followed her here,
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
Come and get it if you can.
Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
Only the sword will settle this.
Let them look.
I will.
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Yes.
Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
Have you questioned him yet?
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
What about you?
Shu Lien...
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
But don't be too lenient.
I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
This is a delicate matter.
Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
I saw it, too.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
Out.  Now.  I gotta work.
I have to go.
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
I don't know you...
Take the dope, too.
That's ancient history.
A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
I can see her.
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
Magic.
Your pain ends now.
Interested?  Follow the crow.
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Fine with me.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Is he inside?
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
Annette Harrison.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
You what?
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
On my mother's life.
A friend wrote me.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
That's a matter of opinion.
Thank you.
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
Refreshing.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
I do not.
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
I have feelings for you.
Yes.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
Hi.
It was perfect.
Sure.
I love you.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
Where did you say she's from?
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
Eww. No. That's gross.
I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.
Why?
You'd do that for me?
Best friends.
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
Well... not exactly.
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.
You promised to let me kiss you.
I'm taking a shower.
I know.
Same time next week?
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
Jesus!
Get out of here.
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
I'll be in touch.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
Outstanding.
Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
Even there?
Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
Yippy.
Yeah.
What's your problem?
And that's why you're losing your bet?
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
She shot you down.
Where is she?
Oh yes.
I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
Mock, mock, mock.
Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away.
I've never done this before.
I have a flair for drama.
You wanted an answer to your question.
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
I know. She's so young and he's so -
You will be discreet about this?
You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you.
I'll do that.
I need to talk to Annette.
It's really important.
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
What are you talking about?
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
I'd love to.
I know how it is.  My Dad collects miniature canon.
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
Do you know the people?
But it's already come true.
What's her name?
Irena.
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
It's early yet.
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
I think I should.  3000W?
What do you mean?
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
I suppose so.
That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.
This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
For as long as you'll let me.
A princess?
Your children?
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
Oh, please!
I'm trying to.
Will you come soon?
But she's such a nice lady.
But it was alive — it was fast and strong!
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days — those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
Why hasn't he got a head?
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
Got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, Mr. Reed.  I thought I'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean.
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
Can we get some service here?
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
No, it was another woman.
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
Maybe he's just shy.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
Did I kill him? Of course not!
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
My vision got worse again.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
Give him the tampon test.
You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
No you don't, believe me.
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!
Tuesday. Are you okay?
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
I could smell another woman on him.
Hide him.
I think I already have.
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
So you're Grant's secretary?
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
Yeah?
On your desk.
Your desk.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
Very well then. Is that all?
Are you following me?
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
So what book did you buy?
No really, I love knowing what people read.
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
No, I got it. It's okay.
Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
No, my bite's a lot worse.
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!
What about... those guys... I might have...
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
We can just take this pillowcase.
I told you she was innocent.
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
This one walk you home too?
It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
And that was 28 days ago today.
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
Not really...
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
He tried to kill me!
He's seriously disturbed...
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnít with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, howís your mother?
A hunch.  He might be able to...
Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
Shut-up.
Why are they after you?
It sure isn't the fun-fair.
What?  Who has?
No...  No doctor...
Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.
Just let me sit here for a moment? Iíll go soon, and stop bothering you.
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
Don't worry.
Don't worry about it.
I mean,  if it's a problem...
) Listen, you little...
Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
I'm... not... nobody...
I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here.
Up and around?  Soon?
What about containment, Alan?
And...
What do you mean, he's clean?
Clean.
Are you out of your mind?
Bob...
Then we'll all go to jail together.
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
It's fine.
Why would they do that.  They hired me.
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
That'd be great.
I'm afraid so.
I see what you mean.
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
Fine.
Absolutely.  Well, that might be kind of tough. Once the press starts smelling blood...
You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
Oh... Thanks.
What do you mean?
He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.
Oh... Kinda the same way.
Yeah.
What about it?
Certainly.
The Vice-President...
Well...
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
I don't know.
They asked me to help.
Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
You find people jobs?
Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
What?
Yeah, well... It's finally over.
Yeah... It could be fun.
Dammit...  I told them no mayo.  See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...
It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
All set.
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.
I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
Come on. Let's go.
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love...
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
I'm alright. Let's go.
Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
Well, no shit, Sherlock
Hey, this is great.
What is the point?
Yep.
Except sex.
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
And are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say?  If all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other, what the hell are we doing?
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
That's not my fault.
Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!
My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it.  The sax is more sonorous.
I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.
Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks?  If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up.  All your asses are safe.  Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what?
No.
What good will that do?
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
Are you going with Chet?
Then come with me.
Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
Dead Poets honor.
It's just for a little while. You promised.
Courtyard?
Then you're playing a part for him too, aren't you?  A dangerously self- destructive one.
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
I can't just forget her, Pitts.  And I certainly can't think about math!
You have another choice.
God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.
Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
Yea, art thou there?
Yes.
He's the owner...
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
How soon can we get up and running?
And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there.
I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
Shut up!
That's where my boat's moored.
The thieves.
You hear that?
Jesus Christ lady...
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
You people...rich people...
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
He's not coming...
Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones...
Joey...
That way.
I have been.
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
Nothing.
You're full of shit!
Jesus, it's freezing!
It won't open.
Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
You mean...?
Worse since she talked to who?
Yeah.
What hospital is he in? Where?
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
Psst. Vince!
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
Linda, Linda...!
Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
Right here.
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
What?
I... No. You do this for money?
Up north.
We... Three bullets.
I want to go home, Merle.
What are you, God?
They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
What else?
Three bullets -- minimum.
Nick!... I thought you went home.
You wanna bet?
How much? How much do you wanna bet?
No!!!?
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
See you Monday.
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
No.
No.
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
Up.
Down.
Technothugs?
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
Who are you?  What the fuck do you want?
Fuck you - fuck you.
Your mother.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
I'll be alright.
We have to talk.
That wasn't your plan, was it?
He could be brought back.
Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
How do I look?
Shut up!  Drop it.
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
Doucet killed my partner.
Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
Yes.
Relax, let technology do the work.
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
What else did he get?
...Have you been drinking?
If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.
And you should be with your family.
What's it mean?
Take a look at this.
Good to know you, Willy.
The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?
I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --
No, thank you -- what's your name?
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
That's my problem, Belle.
It hasn't opened yet?
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
Howdy, Hank.
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
No, you're not.
Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
But what becomes of our souls?
Opportunities?
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
Well, I --
Shall we?
Morning, Jabez.
Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
Oh, Jabez.
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
I'll get it, Jabez.
Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
I don't know, Jabez.
Jabez!
Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez!
I dunno.
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
I'll do my best, Mary.
Hullooo!
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!
I object.
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
But meant her moving here.
So, why didn't you come?
Mind if I play some tunes?
Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I can handle these clowns.  I want to talk to Hans.  Hans! Sprickenzie talk?
Ellis, what have you told them?
And if he alters it...?						*
Who are you, then?
Only if New Jersey counts.
We may have some problems.  How is your schedule?
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
Pomona!  You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.
Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks.
I'm ahead of you...partner.
Thanks...partner.
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.
I'm here, cowboy.
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
In my youth, partner.  In my youth.
I...I shot a kid.
Ask the FBI.  They've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it, step by step.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!
He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
Yeah.
Okay.
Heidi, I'm dying.
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
I'm really shakey.
What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
You're crazy.
You're really crazy.
How did they think that?  What are they... crazy?  What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving you a fucken story.
Do you still want the operation?
Right.  See you sometime.
What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.
What do you want to know that for?
Call me whatever you want.
I frisk you?
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
Come on.  I want you to see something.
I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room.  I want you to see this.
I want to see my wife.  I want you to bring her down here.
Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
What else?
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
He's groggy, Sonny.  Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back. 
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
Well, they go to guard school.
If you take anybody, please take me.
I'll be God damned if you will.
They look like good kids.
Would I hire you?
Everything's all right?  You okay?
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
No, not until after they killed him.
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
Pure?
For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
Fuck him - let him out!
Let's go, Sonny.
I want him to think that.
But I want to know what you think.
What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
Get over there!
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
The manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad.
It's my mother.  Who needs this shit?
We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready?
I speak what I feel.
Who the hell is that?  God damn it! What the...
I forgot she's in here.
Yeah - it looks real official.
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
Oh.  Run.
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
Okay, newsman.  How much you make a week?  You're not talkin'.  You payin' me? What have you got for me?  We're givin' you entertainment ... what are you givin' us?
Oh yeah?  Give up?  You ever been in prison?
Yesterday I received an e-mail from a source. In this e-mail were four social security numbers linked to the gentlemen who presented counterfeit California driver's licenses to my company late last night.
<i>Morning.</i>
<i>I'm gonna kill you, Ed.</i>
<i>The children like to urinate in the balls.</i>
<i>What is it?</i>
<i>Remove... ... the... right arm.</i>
<i>I won't forget this, Domino. I'm sorry it turned out like this...</i>
That bitch called me a bitch.
What?
I fucked up. You can't help your greedy black lying ass from trying to get everything. All you've done is put a death sentence on Meeka.
Yes.
No. Please enlighten me.
Turn over your weapon, Edna!
Fuck 'em. Their loss is our gain. Put the money in the safe until we hear from Claremont. <b>
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
He used to date Pat Benatar!
I was a musician.
I found him pan-handling on Third Street Promenade. Took him under my wing. We been hunting together ever since.
Hello?
You have sixty seconds... here's the question...  Which one of you is Frances?
Claremont said we deliver the First Ladies in Needles. Then we go home. No questions asked.
They're gonna edit it together out of sequence so it's more exciting. <b> EXT. BEVERLY HILLS -- LATER ON
Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.
You got my back.
My brother.
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
So, in other words, you are not down.
You come in here at least three times a day.  You a retard?  A buck fifty.
I don't know how he does it.
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
One day you'll be nice to me.  We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice.  At least civil.
I didn't.
We're still standing.
Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
I just come home to take a quick shower.
Stop tripping.
What are you so worked up about?
He's just being nice.
He's completely innocent.
You are too crude.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?
I got nowhere to go.  We haven't had a good sit-down for a long while.
Sorry, comb got caught.
It's a motherfucking shame.
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
Him no white.  Him no white.
Be off in a second.  Tina, I dedicated a record on Mister Señor Love Daddy's show to you.
No, just checking.
I wants my money.  I wants to get paid.
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
Where's the ice cream?  The Häagen- Dazs butter pecan?
I can run out and get it.
I can't be staying long anyway.
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
Da Mayor ain't no bum.
It's Prince.  He's a Prince freak.
On the rebound.
Sez who?
Vito, get a broom and sweep out front.
I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.
Here, take the broom.  The front needs sweeping.
Tell 'em, Pop.
Actually we have something for you.
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
... to the tune of "Only the Lonely" by Roy Orbison.
I'll tell you why!
Four colors? Neato!
Heddo Jeth-ica.
A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
Ooh gross.
Yeah, but I'm buying.
What? No! Look.
Famous? I've never heard of it.
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
I don't follow.
I know I am, Mom.
Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
The second R is silent.
JESSICA? Please hold for my reaction.
Sounds like a pirate.
A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
LLOYD, she's my mom.
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
Don't look directly at him.
And he invented fire.
Maybe I should go home and grade papers. Owwww.
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
Our own special bus.
Wanna bet?
Hey, where did you come from?
So, have you given him "some" yet? 
HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.
I know I did.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this.
And with that complete loser
That's the one I wanted.
Try one in a million!
Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
No.
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
Duh. I'm in your class at school.
I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
Can you believe it?
What are you talking about?
Uh-oh. Harry?
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
You know I do!
Thanks, Pop.
Class, please study on your own. There seems to be a family emergency because there's no other reason why my father would interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING!
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
Or maybe crossing a river!
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless.
No, it actually fit quite nicely.  Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide.
Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke.
I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
Yes!
And...?
What?
Just like the President.
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
Love it!
No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse.
Piter.
I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
Nothing.
Oh yes? -- NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.
LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
I'm sorry Gurney.
My Lord?
Where are we do you think?
I'm ready.
Yes...
I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
What is it?
Stop him, Jessica!
Those sounds could be imitated.
My father sent you to test me. Music then?
I predict we're lost.
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
Huh?
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character!  Bunny, Bela's here.  Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  <u>I need transvestites</u>!
Ah, so I pull the strings!
They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
Nah.  This happens all the time...
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
Ach!  How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  This live television is madness!
I never said I could ad-lib...
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
Huh?
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
Yes!  I've dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize I've got to take action.  GOODBYE, PENIS!
And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
Rolling.
This is kind of a stream--
I made it up.  It's horseshit!
What?
Boris Karloff!?
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait...
Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
Like <u>what</u>?!
I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
That's not true --
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
Would that work?
It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
Okey-dokey.
Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
We're escaping!
Yes?
So you're not a fruit?
You gotta be kiddin' me.
There's still a sex-change --
I am.  How's your father?
Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...
Okay?
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
Yes!
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
I do.
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.
What if--you're vomiting?
Anything good?
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
Yeah. Ma...
Come on...
Who?
Went --
Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
You're nuts.
She doesn't give a shit about him.
No, uh...
And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.
Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
This guy.
Yes?
Mm...  Oh, man...
Who?
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
Right.
Oh.
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.
Yes to me or yes to the coil?
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
What's the matter?!
Ma...
Shari, Ray feels --
What are you talking about?
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
You batted or you bunted?
Well, then I'm quitting.
Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you.
Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
So maybe this is my dynamite.
I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
Okay ...
Look, not having been there... I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.
That's lucky.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
Somewhere.
...yeah?
The what?
What?
What did you do to your hair?
What do we have to do?
I know. I mean I'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and I'm playing "Risk," with her kid brother, Leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls -- at least I hope it was the dog. 'Cause her mother disappeared for a while.
What is?!
We're excited.
Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.
I don't know.
Hey. Check this out.  Look at this.
No. What happened?
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
Ray --
Ray, come an--
Me?! That's you!
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
Who's Shari?
It's Ed.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
What...
Hi.
Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh...  I'd better get a cab.
We have to stop meeting like this.
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
Ed?
Yeah. Why?
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
Here, get down.
Yeah, just --
What?
I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down
But, Mr. M. -
So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.
Looks like Tim Kobza.
That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?
Hello, Tracy.
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
You will.
Okay, Jim. I understand.
Sure.
Okay.  Give me the drill.
Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
You're there.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting.
Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Don't you fucking knock?
Paul, get out!
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
Yeah, plain scotch.
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
It's Lynn.
When they deserve it.
This business, Captain?
Call me Dudley.
Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
How?
Of course... But how?
What work?
You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
Stens?  Was it Stens?
No!  Please leave!
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
I spent years trying not to live down to mine. 
Of course...
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
I don't have time.  I have --
I never truck with no sissies!
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
The youngest applicant by eight years.
Answer yes or no.
Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
His blood's always up.
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
And now you'll provide them.
<u>Really</u>?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?
Okay.  I'll do it.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
That's right.
<u>Throwing me</u>?
What?
I want to do it right.
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
Of his penis, sir?
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
I know how he feels.
Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
What's Dudley's scheme?
Officer White?
Is she?
Yeah, it's subtle.
Something good?
Sid, how are they hanging?
What's he doing here, Sid?
Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
What's wrong, Trash?
Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
I just called it.
A bootleg...
Yeah.
Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.
Oh Jesus.
Nothing.
I'm telling you, I--
Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
Turn on CNN.
When can you get it here?
Be careful, Danny.
Why?
Told by whom?
Who are they?
What do they have to do with this?
Wait.
It's a SAT-tracker.
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
If you find something, chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville. It's South of Salisbury.  And take this.
I called from a payphone!
You told me no calls.
Oh, I'll bet <u>that</u> threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice!
They come after you?
Yeah.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
<u>Here</u>?!
'Kay, well, could you walk faster, please.
That wasn't so hard.
We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
No.
No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert.
Hello. Hello, Maria.
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
A report?
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
Not that I could see.
To buy lingerie.
Yes sir.
This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.
I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.
In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
It's okay.
There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.
Stacy--
I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
That was for Christmas.
A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
Will you hang on just a second.
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
We're screwed.
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
I'm sorry about that.
We believe he did.
We'd rather not--
We'd rather not--
Shut the fuck up.
Oh, well, that's true.
This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
Fuck off.
The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
Hi, dad.
Are those my Christmas presents?
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
Did they take your clothes?
You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
The blender?
They only took electrical appliances.
Table 122?
Bobby--
Bobby--
Calm down.
Jesus.
Why would they--
You're tired.
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
Yeah?
He got hit by a bus.
You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
We're not gonna hand you and your band of lunatics the keys to the kingdom. I'm not gonna sit in Congress and write a law that allows the NSA to point a camera and a microphone at anything they damn well feel like. And the next time you have something to say to me, we do it above-board, in my office, like everyone else. Now get outa my car, I've got a committee meeting on the hill.
Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
We believe?
Lyle?!
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
Puffed cheese?
Hello!  Good morning.
I don't want to go back.
I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would.
In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
Now.
A lie.  What do you hate most?
Shall we be all right?
Don't go over it again, please.
No.
I can't move.  I can't get out.
I'm just going to find things for the fire.
Yes.  Absolutely.
Listen to me, Katharine.  You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it.  I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel.  And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.
Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
There you have me.
You too.  Good luck!
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
What?
Could I trouble you for some water?
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
Okay.
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
Where've you been?
Some gave me a dress.  You know what's great?  What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that.
Ask him.
What?  How could he have?  When?
No-one should own music.  The real question is who wrote the song?
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
Are you planning to be the exception?
I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
Me?
And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
Oh really?
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
What?
Apprentices.
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
I can already see.
Are you crazy?
Because I'm a nurse.
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
Yes?
Well then - yes.  Of course.
In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
You get Hardy.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
It doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can muddle through.  Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife -  One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -
I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
Why?  Are you German?
There are times when you don't answer the phone.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
Put the bolts on that window under a scope, I'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them.
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
I don't know, but close.
He's on to something bigger.
Uh. I'm showing off.
It's sold.
How about if you try disappearing.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
I'll call an ambulance.
Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
Possibly.
Not a word.
It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
Can you follow simple directions?
Look on the back. What do you see?
Got it.
No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure.
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
We're doing this together. We're partners.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
It's---beautiful.
Little celebration before we set off.
Behind you.
Duh.
Shut up.
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
Hold the record. Alone.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
My job, my rules.
Right. The eight billion.
Feeling old?
Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
FUCKING THING!!!
I sincerely hope not.
That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
This better be worth 1t.
It better be worth it for me.
I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
Remind me why.
We're supposed to.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
You know where my loyalties lie.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
What do you think?  What's this?
Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
What's your point?
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
Yes?
Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records.  They kinda surprised me --
Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
Wow.  Why would they do that?
Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
Any school you want.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?
And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?
<u>No</u>.
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.
I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day.
You might want to think real hard about the amount, too.  My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now, cause I still don't make enough to afford good child care. Makes me think about looking around for a job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake.
It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case.  Their lawyers go --
Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --
Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
Say you were wrong.
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
How do you know that?
You see your office?
What do you mean?
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.
Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...
How come you're not eating?
Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
In the conference --
We'll see.
I'm gonna go live with George.
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
You got a little girl?
Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
What do you mean?
Fixing a leak under your sink.
How would you know?
Nothing.
What's that?
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
Hunh-uh.  Not yet.  Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
That's okay.  I understand.
A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.
What do I look like, Erin?  A library?
What's going on?
Have you been logging on?
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too.  Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door.
Yes?
No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
Ben ... Ben ...
But Han and Leia will surely die.
And that is why I must go.
Growls a reserved greeting.
What's wrong with him?
Okay, okay.
Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
What happened?
Barks his agreement.
Barks his Òright on!Ó
Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
What was it?
An Imperial probe droid.
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
Or you ran into something ....
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
Would you please stop calling me that?
Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
Try and control this ...
There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
No lightspeed?
You're going to attack them?!!!
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
Never heard of that system.
A mining colony.
Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
I always said you were a gentleman.
Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.
You may call me Leia.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
Are the coordinates set?
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
What is it?
Closer?!
I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
What are you talking about?
Why not me?
But I feel The Force flowing!
It is the future you see.
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
If it must be.  Yes.
Time will tell.
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
You never heard of Snake Plissken?
Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.
What?
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
So what does this thing do?
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
Yeah, I got it.
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
The what?
Sewers. Come on.
How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
You're running out of time.
I'm looking for somebody.
Yeah.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
...Perceval!
I cannot--
I gave up my castles and my lands!
And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.
Only give me leave to ride out again, to do what I am most able to do, and happiest doing.
It is deep...
Of Merlin?
Speak of the devil!...
But not from your destiny.
That's not why you came.
'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
...of course...
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind.
I had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so I could get some honey, and I didn't feel up to using any more magic just yet. Anyway, I was in less danger than you'll be in today.
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
What is it my child?
I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?
You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king...
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
Not you, my husband?
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
Because you and the land are one.
--Nothing!
He has given up.
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
Can it truly be used for magic?
That I cannot.
Why?
I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.
What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
Well what's wrong?
Fuck it.
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
Thank you your excellency.
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
No, she was heavily sedated.
Really? wow.
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
She is going to be well?
What is it? A tranquilizer?
And those lies she's been telling?
Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
Please go away.
Sure did.
He didn't mention her.
That depends.
I beg your pardon?
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
Please.
In Europe.
Oh............
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Captain Howdy.
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
What?
Okay.
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
So something please Doctor, Help her!
So what's wrong with her?
I'm not Regan.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
In time.
Holy water.
How's your leg?
No.
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-
The Lord be with you.
Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
Amen
Only what I read in the papers.
I've seen it.
Fuck him!!!
You killed your mother!!! You left her alone to die!!!! She'll never forgive you!!! Bastard!!!
Just a minute.
You're not going to drive.
Little slow tonight.
Your pay.
Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
We have some lotion.
You bring trunks, Jack?
Teeth.
They're falling out.
Accident?
Get your hand off me.
Go fuck yourself.
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
Recognize these two characters?
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Twenty-eight years, Frank.
Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
Fuck him.
I hate your kids, Frank.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
Funny.  Strike a bell?
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
You'll see.
What do you mean?
Talk.
We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
Let's get it over with.
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
I didn't get her number.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.
I'll take my chances.
You recognized me.
So what do you think?
Thanks, but I've got plans.
Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.
Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
Okay.
Okay.
Good idea.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?
I love you.  I just wanted to say it.
Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
Huh?
A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
February?
Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
You're making things up, Frank.
Just until we find another girl.
A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
Who's weak now, big brother?
Later.
I can keep the beat.
Spur of the moment.
All right.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
Well, that's fine --
Right.
It's one of Jack's favorites.
Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.
Yes, it is.
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
That's the premise.
When we know.
What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
Changed?
Hey!
Uh... good.
Right.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
Switch?  What fucking switch?
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.
So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.
Virgins.
Huh?
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
Thanks, Lloyd.
Uh ... thanks.
Gotta go.
Come on, Ed.
Black.  Labrador.
Downstairs.
For a while.  She left.
The Stratford.
You want me to walk you?
I guess in case one year they're not.
It's okay.  Last one.
Hey, business is business.
Nothing.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
Who's Nina?
How come you didn't close your eyes?
Huh?
Long story.
You're kidding.
So, what happened?
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
Huh?
Hi.
No.
I didn't want to wake you.
Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
Losing his teeth.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
Wow.
Why not?
Merry Christmas.
Sure.
Eddie.
You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm.
Yeah -- me.
Drive.
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
Is that what you think?
Something good?
Must've been after we got engaged.
How come?
And you wouldn't be.
Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
Pollux is -- what?
You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
Like you know anything about it.
You mean like ... condoms?
Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you.  Here, mom.  You can have it back.  Thanks, though.
That's your name, isn't it?
What happened?
No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
No problem.
Normally, I would.  But today ...
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
Have fun at work.
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
You?  Married?
So you left her?  Just like that?
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody’s here.
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
Five thirty.  Okay.
Got it.  Good tip.
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Great room...
Is it...?
She wants to have an affair with me.
We bowl together. We’re bowlers ...we won a championship...we’re winners.
Yes...Jack Campbell...
Yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
What the hell are you talking about?  What’s he talking about?
Hey...
I've got everything I need.
You mean because you thought I was cocky I’m now on a permanent acid trip?!!
I asked you a direct question!  A glimpse of what?!
How much time?!
Look Jack I’m late.  I’d love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business...  Happy trails.
It would help me if we were.
What are you talking about?  It’s me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
Yeah...fine.
I was in the city.
Look, you don’t understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
Party?  Oh no, I can’t go to a party...
Uh huh...
And...?
Well that’s just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
That is the general idea, yes...
Do what?
Sure.  I really like Annie.
That’s why I work for Big Ed?
That’s my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Nice, Jack.  You’re sweeping me off my feet.
No, open it...
Are you sure?
But you always seem so certain.
That’s a big one for me, too.
What are you sure about?
Think bigger.
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Then get a goddamn snow blower!
Look, you’re making this into something it’s not. This isn’t a referendum on our lives, Kate. It’s a step forward...  Don’t you see?  I’m talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
Promise me again...
Jack...God, it’s been so long...You look...
Don’t worry about it, Jack...
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and I’m going to be heading it up.
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
Hello Jack.  You don’t have to stop singing on my account...
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.
You'd never know it.
Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
This makes five.
Victor's better at these things.
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
Victor must've taken him.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
Ben!  Ben!
Ben, are you there?
You've been working out.
Oh, it is.
Gotcha.  Okay.  Supernova bad.
Right, whatever, have fun.
But all these people...
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
Last one down springs for room service.
Not at all.
Hilarious.
Sure.
Reed, we're running out of time.
Passion.
What?  What do you mean you --
What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
And reverse the mutations --
Of course.  Of course.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
You <u>need</u> a doctor.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Raising the shields.
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
<Me>?
That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
Yes?
And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
We'll know -- in the next breath...
We must!
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
You may learn to like it.
Now I know...
I have no idea.
You can't --it's too dangerous --
Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --
I feel much better now...
Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
Maybe we can...  Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?
Then why not take it?
If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.
Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
I'm married.
Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
What I was afraid would happen. The stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --
Then don't drift down further.
Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.
Whoa, Daddy.
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
Personal matters.
My wife! What the - how's -
What the heck d'ya mean?
Oh, for Chrissakes here -
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
You have children?
Oh, now he's adorable.
Oh, he's adorable.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
I unnerstand.
Uh-huh - in what way?
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Mm.
Uh-huh... A what?
Chaska.
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
Oh, yah?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Oh, man!
Oh, those numbers are all right, bleemee.
...My fee? Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
Ya kiddin'!
Look, Dad, there is no fucking way -
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Dad's here.
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
No, no, fax is -
Okay.
Know who this is?
My patience is at an end.
Good day, sir.
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
Yah.
You told me about it.
A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
We might be innarested.
Yah.
No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
...There's a million dollars here!
Mm.
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
Yah?
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
Yah...
No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
Gotta go?
Well, how the heck are ya?
Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie!
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
Well, yah, I was married. I was married to - You mind if I sit over here?
I was so... I been so... and then I saw you on TV, and I remembered, ya know... I always liked you...
It's okay...
Margie Olmstead?
This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me?
Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
We've got a -
Yah?
Uh-huh.
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
Yah.
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
I love you, Norm.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
Well... Why don't we...
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
We're still men.
Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men Together?"
Yeah, both of us.
Have you finished those reports?
"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
Yes?
-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
I don't know -- am I?
The girl had done her homework.
We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
... A person.
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
We've just lost cabin pressure.
Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll never have to see me again.  Here... here...
I'm begging you.  Get on the bus. Get on the bus.
Don't ask.
Yes.
Who's this?
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
Who do you think I am?
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
Pardon me?
...no ...no ...
The things you own, they end up owning you.
A hotel?
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
It's called a "changeover."  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
This is crazy.
Strange.
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
Look at your hand.
I don't know...
Tell him!
Imagine how he feels.
Fight club was the beginning.  Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem.
Tyler...
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
... is over.
Why do people think I'm you?
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
Answer me, Tyler.
What about them?  They're lunatics.
What about Marla?
I'm going to...
If you know, I know.
I quit.
Yes.
Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. 
Why are you doing this?!
What have you left for me?
Very good, Sir.
You told me you'd say that.
Well, sir, you said you might.
No!
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
Signs?
How can you say that?  What kind of monster are you?
I...I...
I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
Taken care of.
If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...
I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
No.  What's this about?
Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
I'm not following you --
Hold on.
It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?
I know how it feels to be dead.
Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
I know, we'll be there soon.
Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.
It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
Thirty-nine.
Like... 4:25.
Right. April 25th.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
Let us out!
Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
That's a plan.
Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
In Death...
Design?
No harm. No foul.
I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!
No.
Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...
Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
There are no worse places.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
Nothing we can do, man.
Duck soup.
How much we got left in that minigun?
Sure.  I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
Spooks?
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
Why you don't feel love?  Not allowed?  Dead inside, maybe?  You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?  In-vulnerabo?  Bullshit!
Let's get that tent down!
Not yet.
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
Christ almighty.
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
Have fun.
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.
Can you walk?
I could take it or leave it.
That's it.  My life.
Yeah.  Big time.
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
Meeting ... people.
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
Why this is outrageous!...
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
No.  So what time do you need?  I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great!  I'd like to be a part of it -- I think I deserve that!  So what do you need to figure out alone!?
How have you been?
Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl...
Where?  Maybe we can.
Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.
NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step on me.  Leave me alone!!
It was a crime.
I... I was just leaving.
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
Tonight!  How's tonight?
Great place huh?
<u>What</u>!?
I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
Parry... I'm Jack.
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
The Red Knight!
Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.
It's a classic.
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Sure...
I know!
You advise us!
<u>Nothing!</u> <u>They</u> <u>can</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing!</u> <u>Gentlemen!</u>
There isn't any more to tell.
You don't have to say that.
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
Twinky?
Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!
I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!
Well, lemme play the other side then.
You said.
Yeah, great.  Why don't you throw Z's for 19 frames, and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a losing game? Just wonderful.
I love it.
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
Washington.
It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...
I didn't get it, did I?
Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.
You know who it once belonged to?
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
Uhm hmm.
I don't know.
Yeah, well, he's...
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
Bye, Robert.
That's dangerous, you know.
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
I didn't have any.
Yes, that's what's important to me...
Is he?
Will you let me talk to you, please?
Just give me a chance, will you?
Yes.
What?
Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
I do eat slow as a bird, whereas Bobby can put it away like a speed swing...  Is there any ketchup around?
It is true.
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
Jesus, what a rude person...
I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
Oh, for pity's sake...
Look at me.
Then don't go out with me.
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
Victor.
Wussup, Victor.
Eddie from Baruch, the one who was sittin' wit' dat little girl;
I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,
C'mon.
Eddie from Compost?
She lives near Eddie?
So, then whadda ya want?
Not really.
Wha'?
Jus' from around the way.
By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
Fletch, this is dumb.
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
It was planted on me, sir.
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
Yes.
Well, which one?
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
Oh, he was dying for years.
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
Okay. Some idea.
Like tonight.
No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
What?
Gum thought Brazil.
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
Yes, right away.
He'll be so relieved.
My lawyer was a bum.
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
Course he has. That's his wife.
Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --
You sure did.
Right.
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
I'm all ears.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
Can I steal you for a minute?
Not our kind of people, you understand.
You doing a story on this guy?
That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while.
Yeah.
Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
You've met her?
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
John Ultrarelamensky.
Preoccupied with what?
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
I ordered lunch.
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
I saved his life during the war.
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
Yeah.
What does all this mean?
Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
I think you better sit down.
Gail, please.
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
Bastard.
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
What?
Who are you?
Moved out.
This morning.
Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
...never reads the paper...
I don't know.  Look!
You broke it? You know the source?
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
Well, there we're in a gray area.
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
Utah?
What about finding the source?
Who? Donnie and Marie?
I want something I can print!
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
Frieda's boss.
Who's your decorator?
I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
Who?
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
What did these Vancouver factories do?
Thanks, I needed that.
Great pipes.
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.
Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
Yeah, let's bury her.
I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s
Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.
Why are all these people after me?
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.
But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
Are you okay?
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
Ciao.
Fuck me...
Julian, you're fired.
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
Doyle.
What?
I'm clean.
No - no.
Boca?
Fuck you, Santa Claus!
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
Pour moi?
Je n'ai jamais vu tant de sérenité. Elle m'a demandé de tes nouvelles et si nous étions heureux.
I'm going to put them on the cat.
What happens to the schedule?
But will they?
What?
What's he do?
Marseilles.
Strike out, eh?
Who's on him?
Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and I'll knock you into the middle of next week.
Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
Suspicion of what?
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
I can't.
Let yourself in.
The other guy's a frog too.  Checked in at the Edison.  Had a hooker sent up.
I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
Four.
So what?
Switches are shorted out.
Hey, bud.
Well, why not a little of the King?
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
He ain't the only one.
Luck, my ass.
Hello, Frank.
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?
Daddy, I'm scared.
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
I can't believe people are still using these things.
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
What'd you just say?
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
What's happening?
Sun spot?
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
I think I'm losing you.
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
Fire.
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
I don't understand.
Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
She's not here.
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
I'm right here, Dad.
I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
Okay, okay...
What's wrong?
What the hell is that smell?
Yeah.  That's it.
Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
Sounds good.
So how are things at the hospital?
Yeah, that's right.
I hear that.
No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared thirty years ago.  Found her bones last week.  Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
Where's Shelly?
Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
I'll think of something.
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
What?
I love you, man!
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
You go ahead...
Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
It's deceiving.
You promised you'd never ask me.
It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
Sort of.
My whole world.
Why don't you help us?
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Everything's gonna be fine.
May be please have the wallet.
Yes.
No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
I have to.
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
All he's asking is for you to check it out.
We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
Daddy, what is going on?
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
Uh...yes.  But...
'Cause it stinks.
Did you hear me?!
I found it outside.
Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."
Yes, but they released me because...
They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
The what?
I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
I know everything about you, Diana.
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
N...nothing.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
That's all right.  I was just...
Oh my God, Steven.
-- Bad?!
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
Really?
He bought you that?
Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now? Come on, it's grad night. You've got your whole life to be uptight.
And you'll never do it again.
Rennie's not coming.
They're out of town.
I packed it. Just for us.
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
No, I think it's just the beginning.
Where is she?
Walking corpses are not real!
What are you talking about?
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
But Sean said...
Really?
That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
Hi, Sean.
We changed our minds.
Is the ship going to sink??
Very big.
You are going where?
Press a button and they give us money.
I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
Then you should carry a gun.
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
She's dying.
I talked to her two days ago.
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
We don't even like each other, do we?
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
Except I won't have a father anymore.
Yes.
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
Who the hell cares?
That's always been my problem.
Joanne Bourne.
I'm glad we're having this talk.
Washed away.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
I can't find it.
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
Life is good.
Washed away.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
You're out of bullets.
You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
Sidney.
I have excellent long-term memory.
I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
I think I remember.
What?
The fact is, I have to get going.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
Someone waiting for you?
There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
All the more reason.
Eleven.
Did they take your clothes?
It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
There is nothing I can give.
It's split the Government.
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
I congratulate them.
Who's leading them?
No -- but I think I'm going to.
If you did this, no one could control it. No one.
...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
Now is your chance to find out.
Er, no...
A man's dead, Detective.
Grudges?
No, <i>this</i> is your man.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
Something's not right.
I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
Luca could still be an accomplice.
Where did you get this?
We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  We're already counting backwards.
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
Michael's.
You may as well invite her here.
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
In case you get back before I do.
I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
--We didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
German, is that you?
Yes.
Why would we do that?
They found an eyelash.
What exactly is wrong?
Of course.
You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
We could go together one day.
Only every time I'm in here.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
New policy.
I get my own help.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
Yeah.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
Just the way I remembered.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
You were asleep.
That bad?
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
When are you going to learn?
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
Whatever happens it's over.
You want to try with me?
Get your clothes on, move your butt.
Pull over.
We walk.
No, I'm afraid not.
Tell her you robbed a bank...
Where?
Suit yourself.
How about twenty thousand?
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
How long have you been married?
'Good.'
Yes.
I can't Jack. How can I?
Who sent you, Thorpey?
He's got a new place at Burnham.
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
I must go. I'm in a hurry.
He was all right to me.
Nicer than most.
You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
Yes, I do.
No.
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
So where are we going, Princess?
Of course. Where else?
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
Brumby.
Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
Entertaining.
Not entirely. No.
You've been watching the film.
What girl?
Your brother? What you talking about?
No.
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
They said he was drunk.
No.
What?
Did you work with him, Keith?
Right.
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
Who's Brumby?
Yeah.
Get knotted.
I see.
Definitely.
No.
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?
Yes, thank you.
And that'll make me feel better?
I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
And you should know, if I remember rightly.
Still got your sense of humour.
But they have to be diplomatic.
Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
That's right.
Well, I think I had one once.
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
You get a bad month, all of a...
Some contest board...
Eh?
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
That's right...
That's the truth...
Huh.
You...
What do you mean?
Yes...?
What?
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
What did you say?
That's right.
Did you talk to Graff?
What did he say?
For five thousand?
You're saying "me."
He would take you on.  Yes.
You have to steal the leads tonight?
I'm sorry?
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
So I'm making it concrete.
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
Clear Meadows.  That shit's dead.
They stole the phones.
No.
No.
I'll be at the restaurant. </pre> </html>
Thank you, George.
In school.
Go to lunch, will you...
Go to lunch, George.
Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch? 
Levene!
I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
Could I...
...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
What two?
...do you want to go downtown...?
...then...
Roma.
You know what those leads cost?
The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per...
The leads are assigned randomly...
What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
Twenty percent.
That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
It's not impossible.
What are you talking about?
Well, hadn't it?
Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
Who kept the other half?
That was easy, wasn't it?
You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. 
No, I don't think so, Shel.
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
I'm sorry.
Fuck you.
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
You sold eight Mountain View?
They took the phones...
"You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
Bruce..."I don't want to fuck around with you.  I don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this.  I do, too.  I came here to do good for you and me.  For both of us.  Why take an interim position? 
He's right, Williamson.
The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
Yes.
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
Beautiful.  Beautiful rolling land. I was telling Jim and Jinny, Ray, I want to tell you something.  You, Ray, you eat in a lot of restaurants.  I know you do... 
Well, it isn't coming out until the February iss...sure.  Sure, go ahead, Ricky.
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
What do I...?
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
Yest...
I don't know.
It's not me, it's my wife.
We'll speak to her, Jim...
What does that mean?
I...
It's nothing.
Fuck the Machine.
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
Did they...
The...
Yes.
No, where is it?
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
I can't.
I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
I'm not hungry.
Oh yes, the very best.
She couldn't decide.
That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
I saw him with you.
The children can stay.
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
No.
What is it?  Can I help?
I've always taken care of you.
It's the way Pop wanted it.
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
 And he agreed?
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
I don't know.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
Sure, Mikey.
Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
It was a boy.
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
I don't know.
I'm staying.  Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that.  Now, explain everything to me.
Twenty-five this time.
The room has a bug in it.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.
The witness is excused; take him out.
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
Goodbye, Michael.
The money was sent.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
Very impressive.
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
Let him gamble.
No.
You were unfair with them.
Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
The same assurance we got from you.
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
Yes.
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
What's to be jealous of?
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
You mean us?
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
He is dead now, twenty years.
No!
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
What do I do?
It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.  Enough talk.  I must wake up the master.
I put him to bed.  He's not there?
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
Nice place.
Just that I was in the Marines.
Yeah.  I better get on with my work.
What?  Oh yes.
This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
What was wrong?
Huh?
But why?
All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.
We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.
Did anyone laugh?
No.  I could have, though.
In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
Do you miss it?
How long were you...?
I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
You first.
Not fear.  More like disgust.
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
No, my dear.  The Crimean War. What do you think?  The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had --
I didn't --
No harm done.
You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
Do I look okay?
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
Catch my death.
Good.  Let's get dry.
Do I have any other choice?
Never gave it much thought.
The Great War?
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
What happened?
I'm very sorry.
I don't remember that one.
What'd you say?
What won't do?
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
You're crazy.
All right.
She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
Then who did?
You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better.  That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.
Of course.
Oh dear.
My mind's lovely.  And yours?
A visitor.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
One likes to live simply.
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
Don't go away.
Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
Is there someplace we can talk?
About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
Six years ...
Tell me about Kip -
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.
We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?
Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
My version of "take this job and shove it..."
Point-five ...
"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
By the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ...
How's Atley -- ?
Let them go --
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
You know my back.
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
Consider me gone, Detective --
Cadillac.
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!
Donny-nothin'!
Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
Dignity...
It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"
Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ...
Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
Yes, sir -
You've been pre-booked...
I dunno ...
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
Something like that -
Yeah --
Hey, now -
Me.
Otto called -
How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
Nah.
What?
Sure, man --
What for -- ?
Now, we go -
Hospital.
Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
For real?
Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
What's wrong with her -- ?
She was the only "Annie" you could find?
I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...
A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
Her parole officer strongly recommended it ...
No worries ...
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
I dunno. I know a place.
Hello, Otto ...
"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
No we don't -
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
I'll see you soon --
Who's "Eleanor?"
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
So she flies -
Not really -
Shit all looks the same here --
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
No more shines, Billy.
Oh I Him.
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
You treated me like shit.
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
Liar!
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
I can't do it anymore.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
Paul will calm down. You'll see.
Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I tell you I gotta get out of here first.  I gotta straighten every- thing out with Paulie or I'm dead.
Just get me out.
You know. The stuff I left.
You what?
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
What?
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
I gotta talk to you.
Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
Will you stop.
I can't make any more deliveries.
My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
Keep him here. I'm going for a bag.
Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores were empty.
He's with his friends.
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.
But, Paulie, please.
What? Come on!
What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?
Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
She went to Medical school in California.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Ah, history I think.
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
This is your house, right?
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
You could put a pool in that backyard.
I told you, I just got change.
Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'--
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
Yeah, can I help you?
No students work for me.
Which one's your building?
Well, he didn't show up for work today...
Hey fuck you.
That's right.
Of course.
It's an integer proof.
I think so.
Half-red, half-black--
--Half-red, half-black--
That's fine, but did you ever think--
Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
It's Saturday.
Find out what?
Yeah, cured polio.
Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
That would be fine.
It's on the college.
I been here a couple years.
I think so.
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
Come in.
Sounds good.
There is somebody...
You guys are fuckin' sick.
Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.
Will, your not getting off that easy.
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
I did.
You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
That's right.
Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
I didn't want the job.
I didn't ask for this.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
Cause fuck him, that's why.
Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
Yeah, I think so.
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
Good luck.
I'm Will.
I kind of got that impression.
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
Okay...
Not far from here, South Boston.
Well...
I'm supposed to understand this.
No.
All right, all right. We'll go.
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
I guess so.
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
How do you know that?
Yeah, but how do you know?
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
Goodbye.
Listen, Smart Guy. I'll run my business my own way. I got work. If you wanta take it, okay. If not, just sit here, that's all.
I never knowed they was anything like her!
Let 'er go, Gallagher!
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
Well, you ain't a-goin'! Ain't *nobody* else a-goin'! We *got* here an' we gonna *stay* here, together! As long as we got the fambly unbroke I ain't scared, but it's a long bitter road we got ahead of us--  --an' I'm here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us up anymore I'm a-goin' cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn!
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
Now I can't breathe.
I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.
Fan-belt's shot.
I guess that's what he looked like.
Okay. Go on.
Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.
Four.
Two.
Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
Got a warrant?
I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.
Say, who runs this place?
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
Yeah. On my way home now.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.
Just around that next bend.
I never heard nothin' about it.
I ain't no preacher anymore.
If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture.
But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
I ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this.
Lissen, I heard that before--
What you mean?
Didn' you have no breakfast?
Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.
Take her with you!
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
No'm.
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. We're the people. 
Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
You promised, Tommy.
No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
Comes night we'll get outa here.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
I could hide you, Tommy.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
I shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. I won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in.
Me an' you both.
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
We gonna stay, ain't we?
We gonna take whatever they got.
I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.
I seen 'em b'fore you did.
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
In the corporate offices.
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
Don't say that.
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
What?
Fine, Bob. How are you?
Really?
You could've been a contender, huh?
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
Here is now there. There is here.
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
--She's not dead---
Yes.
No.
Get the fuck outta here.
You never could have kept this from me.
I'll hide.
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion.
No.
Excellent. Here they come.
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Those all seem kind of related...
I guess.
In Portugal, yes.
In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.
If he does our job, he's our job.
There's nothing to be done about it.
See you next week.
Tell them my house exploded.
Jim?
Nature made him then broke the mold.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
You too.
That's too bad.
See you in ten years.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
You sleeping all right in that house?
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
Feel good?
She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
I won't ask you to.
Annie!
I can't do this. I can't leave you...
The point was to love each other.
I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
Fine -- I'll take my bath.
Fine.
Then why do you want to leave?
Don't they believe in signs here?
Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
Yeah, you know everything!!
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
My period.
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity.  I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
Good.
Go ahead...
Who's there?
All right. Speak to you then.
We're very lucky.
Okay.
Sing it to me, Frankie!
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
Take your time.
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
We have a business manager. The best around.
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.
Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
That's what some folks say.
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
We should be fine, then.
I don't have all day.
Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess.  What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?
I know where he goes.
No!
You want to go to a movie tonight?
So?
OK, OK.
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
Don't move!
Hackers of the World, Unite!
Devil book. The Unix Bible.
The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
Yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!
What is it with this guy?
...as they snoop onto us.
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Go fix the phones.
I'm taking over a TV network.
Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
Hmmm.
No. No one special.
Nah. I don't play well with others.
Never heard of you. Done anything?
What's going on?
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
I said give me time.
It's cool, I'm just looking.
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
Do my ears deceive me?
I'll hack the Gibson.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
D'you bring those Crayola books?
Hey, it's me.
Virus?
Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
555-4202.
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
All right.
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
Don't get angry.
You don't owe me anything.
No, you don't understand.
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
She's not dead!
Get back!
Brady! Come with us.
Go!
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
It's okay..it's okay.
I'm not calling the fire department.
About what?
I can see this is useless.
I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help.
How many people in the bus?
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
Outside.
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
Do you love me Rachel?
I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.
In a second.
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
Dad, what's going on?
I don't know.
Okay, bye.
Right here, Ben.
No problem, Sheriff.
This is 132, over.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
Yes.
It isn't a man.
Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
Oh your a pilgrim all right. I saw it on your face back there in the dust. I saw it clear as Breasts and blue suede shoes. Would you like a drink? 
What's going on?
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
He shouts, too.
Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
Fun-ny. See you.
Look where?
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
The guys think I'm too smart.
Why did you hang up on me?
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
He can still watch.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
I can't.
No, he's not.
Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.
Yeah.
Michael's around someplace...
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
I'll be here.
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Have a good time.
Sure.
Sure. Sure.
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
There is no such thing.
What did he look like?
I saw him...
What is it, Laurie?
I'm scared...
You're coming with us...
Will you get her for me?
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
I'm wasting time.
What did you use before?
He'll barely be able to sit up.
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
Oh, listen...
Are you really interested?
You want to see some?
And then, uh, April...huh?
Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
Oh, is that what it is?
Yeah.
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
We're actresses.
What time do you get off?
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
Yes.
Oh, okay.
This time I really think I have something.
Like what?
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
Yeah?
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
We nev-- We don't name names!  We say the Pope.
Oh, what, in this section of town?
Oh.  Well, I live--
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
No?
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I have been in love with you for so long.
Not because of me, I hope.
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
I know it isn't.
No.
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
Are you in love with someone else?
Get his wine away.
Always.
It's on the table, Dad.
Oh, honey!
So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
Mmm...
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
No.
No.
I'm saying it now!
You know... 
Yeah?
But not you.
Like what?!  What?
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
I know, I know, and your hamster.
Okay.
Really?
Here, you guys.  Open them up.
He's fine.
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
I think so.
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
Thanks, thanks.
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
...from Mavis, also.
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
True.
Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
Yeah.
Uh-oh.
I should get a garter belt.
He's not a loser at all!
Well, how about this?
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
You got it.
Hmm!
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
I'm fine.
Yeah?
Yeah, it was.
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
You've always hated my taste in the past.
So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
I am.  You-you made my day.
It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
Oh, yeah?  What?
I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I-- 
I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
Oh...
Hmm.
Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
Or, perhaps...
We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
Here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
Yeah, so where is he?
They got that kind of money?
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
Impossible.
Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>? 
Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank you for coming.  I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
The children...?
Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
Mmm...
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
For a consideration.
Shut up, Starling...
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
...what's he got against you?
...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
You nervous...?
Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
Hey, you know, I never thought of that...
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
...yes, yes, yes...
We got KittyKat...
Is it necessary to know?
Oh, no, no.  It won't be <u>that</u> long.
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
<u>Yes</u>.
...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
...not to turn around.
The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
N'not <u>that</u> sad.
You goin to shoot yourself? 
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
Because we cannot <u>pay</u>...
It's a <u>joke</u>.  You're a joke.  You're a joke.  You don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  That is the fine limit of your ambitions...
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
...no.
What does <u>that</u> mean?
What is your point?
I..
That's when you went to the Orphanage...
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
Why are you...don't stop...why?
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
It is?  I don't know about this, Wichita. Am I even right for Talia?                         ] What About Wendy?

You guys have been so colossal...
Your Secret admirer?
Thanks a lot. Seriously though, by winning this bet, you will prove to the world that you indeed know everything.  Isn't the rush of gambling on your cynical philosophy of life enough?
That wants to be a Yes.
Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley, don't listen to her.
I just don't know about this whole actual sexuality thing--How do you go from being friends with a guy to wanting to put the thing he uses to go to the bathroom with in your mouth?
Clever observation. Go back to Wichita.  Oh that's right, you can't.
Yeah. And?
Hey--whaddya say, we need another muskrat to join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up!  Isn't Fun great!
Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
Talia's a rock. She'll be fine...
Iunno.
About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop.
Do you really think I care?
Betty Finn. Gosh.....
Don't get cocky, girl.
It's not my style, okay?
It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.
Yeah, maybe.
Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.
Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
I didn't. Cherry.
Maybe it's time for a vacation.
S'okay....
You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.
Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
French.
Oh.
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
Remember he's left-handed.
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
You kids are making too much damn noise.
Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
Goddamn Geek!
I guess.
I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
That's three things.
Sure. Ciao.
sits down next to Honora, glass of sherry in hand.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . .
pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
I'm not hungry.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
Well, I guess I take after you then!
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
is very angry.
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
Love, you can still write to each other.
Thank you so much!
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
That . . .
It's so beautiful!
What??
No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
That was what we were led to believe . . .
I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
Your wife...?
You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
Your insight is enlightening.
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.
I'm stumped.
Second most common?
You just made that up.
No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
Ambrose. I know.
Allison Dormere. Your intern.
What's the difference?
Zero's a number right?
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
This isn't happening.
What?
For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
Where's my wife?
I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.
No please make yourself at home.
Thanks.
A little? Try unbelievably.
How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?
... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
I surrender...
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
LaPlante!
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to...
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
It's November.
I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.
Mister LaPlante...
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?
Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
Use the phone, Bernie, call him tomorrow, he'd like to hear from you.  Where's your other shoe? Never mind!  I don't want to know. Some fantastic adventure, right? Something really crazy.
If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
Were you in it?  In the war?
Yes.
And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
You're sitting on your ticket.
Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself.
You wouldn't push the guy, would you?
No, Deak, not a great story.  We backed this guy, he's our boy!  We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars.
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
Dad!
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?
Whoa, check it out.
Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
Sure.
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
Yeah, that was easy.
Isn't that always the way?
-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
A man scared me.
Uh huh.
Why are you mad at each other?
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
Honey, are you okay?
Huh?
Oh -- great.
I know someone else who's sensitive.
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
Did you lock the garage door?
Oh baby.
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
We'll talk in the morning.
What for, dickweed?
Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
No.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
They appear to be authentic.
Yeah -- how'd you know that?
Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
So?
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
What?
That's all?
And what do you think you will find in another land?
We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
No.  What am I to do?
It's done.
She's a treasure she is.
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
I cannot explain.
What are you hoping to find inside?
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
I'll be fine.
Jennifer.
Who was that man last night?
I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more.
You're twenty minutes late.
So?
--for three hundred years.
He will not stop until it is over.
What?  How?
I don't think it is a duplication.
Why did you wait?
Aye -- that I would, lass.
It's not for me to decide.
I love you, Conner.
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
Why?
You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here!
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
What?
I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
There's a million dollars in there, maybe <u>two</u> million.  I'll give you half.
I got the gasoline --
I overheard him with the girl.
You worry about your end.  I got my side covered.
I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
That's okay.  I love you anyway.
Be quiet!  Listen!
How about dog shit?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Stop it.
Whatever.
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
He said something about a girl --
Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile.
They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.
If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  They would see you outside, too --
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
Can you get into the office?
Yes.
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
How do I reach him?
You can let go.
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
I'm sorry, it's a private function.
Cockroaches?
Of course.
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Where is she?
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
What did you overhear?
I'll be over.
No, sir.
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
I will do nothing unless you help me now.
Politics is power, Paul. And money.
Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
Thank God.
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
Just drive, Gregoire.
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
One thousand francs.
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
I will give you my house.
The third floor are low class rooms.
We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
Yes, with Fedens and the children.
Stay with the children.
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
We're running out of beer and other supplies.
What?
What sort of car?
I want to know.
There is one thing I need right away.
Why?
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
The lieutenant wants the register.
We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
Thank you, Roger.
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
Can I help you?
-- the whole thing is falling apart!
More to the point. Where's our host?
-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
C'mon.
Three times, to be exact.
If this is someone's idea of a joke --
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
Left, goddamnit!
What?
Best of a nightmare.
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
It'll have to do.
For chrissake give me a hand!
I don't do groups.
I hope not.
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
-- the sadistic prick --
Where is she?
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
No. OhmyGod, Pritchett was right -- The house <u><b>IS</b></u> haunted.
Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
And then what happens?
I can't remember at the moment.
Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
-- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn --
I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
Over here.
I did a cross search, death certificates with this address. James and Marion Foster.  They had a daughter.  Right here, it says James died, 1882, pneumonia. Marion dies September the next year. Suicide.
It might have been her mother.
Yes.  It was.
Good-bye.
It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.
Maybe it was Colleen...
No it won't - no it won't!
Ok.  If you want this room, you can have it.
For good luck honey.
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
Daddy help!
Good night daddy.
I don't know.  That's strange.
It was in the cellar.  Weird.
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
I think everything's ready.
Know what?
No...  NO!
Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
I could see if I detect the presence of something.
If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
It was a shame.
What!
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
What?
Well what is it!
No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery.  But that's all it is. Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?
And what is ... this frozen moment?
Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
Right.  Right!
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
I'm trying to quit.
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
Taken what?
And he still sits there?
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
I don't know.  Maybe.
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
But how in God's name ...
Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
Gum.
Guards come exactly every three minutes....
Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
Why try?
Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I...
"But we'll be the same as we started...
You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
A little petting is not the issue!
That's what you theenk.
I'll bring my entire repertoire...
Uh....old badminton injury.
Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
You re not "some guy" anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I....
This is too bad to be false.
Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference.
We're here to say, your government was right.
If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....
You want an address on that last one?
The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
No.  But why do you let Butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt?
The Dancing Dingus!
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does...
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
Oh, no, really, I --
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
Every year?
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
Now, Aim --
Worked in a watch factory?
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
He grins wolfishly.
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
Well, why don't ya read it.
Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!
Wait a minute!
Well, I'm a college graduate --
Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...  ...'schmoe'?
But, sir! --
Oh my God, sir!
Sir, my leg is on fire!
Oh my God, sir!
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
There's one in every story.
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
She looks in her purse...
The mark notices.
He don't look wise.
That's nonsense, Alma.
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
Nonsense, child!  I know Wesley's been drinking too much lately.  I know a great deal more about what goes on at Fort Holland than you'd think.  I know all about you -- that you're a nice girl, competent and kind to Jessica.  The Fort needs a girl like you.  But now we've got to get you back there.  I'll walk you back and stay over night.  It'll be a nice change for me.
So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking.
You don't believe in it?
I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
That's rather nice, isn't it?
Mr. Holland?
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
Why did you come in here?
And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
She was beautiful.
The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
Emotion tricks all of us, Mrs. Rand.  And you are a woman with a very strong conscience.  That conscience has been tormenting you. The rest is coincidence.  There is no such thing as a Zombie.  The dead do not come back to life. Death is final.
Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
Why shouldn't she be?
So maybe you'll come too?
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
What do you mean?
What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
In the car.
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you.
We're not going anywhere.
The phone's out.
Ben, I don't think he wants us here.
Yeah.
Sure dad.
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
Ben--
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
Birth control.
I just can't believe you could be so --
Good night kiddo.
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.
Yeah.
That's besides the point.
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
It was lovely!
Let me.
Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
Yeah. You?
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
It'll warm you up.
It's not a bother.
Social work?
Yes.
That's right.
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
Um, Libbets Casey.
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Groovy.  Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
The Idiot?
Great, thanks for the tip.
You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --
Who said so?
I don't have a girlfriend.
Sure, anything but this English.
Yeah. When it freezes, I guess that means the molecules are not moving. So when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body. The molecules have stopped. So it's clean.
I dunno. I --
Huh?
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
With who?
Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
What time is it?
The ones you built?
What are you doing?
Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
Vodka?
Huh?
That's nice. Are you drunk?
Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
We already did.
Twelve years younger.
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
What?
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
That's right.
Don't do this, Hap...
Habit.
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
Huh?
You don't know.
Long as it's fun.
That's what I said.
Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
Yes.
Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me.
No back-up.
They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
We had feared we were the only ones...
Ah! You have questions?
Nothing if not vampires...
Then there is nothing.
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
No.
You made me see their failings, Louis. You made me look at them with your eyes.
Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again.
You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
Is that supposed to frighten me?
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
I took your life. He gave you another one.
And you never cried -
Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I did it for you -
Yes...
You are more beautiful than any of them.
Be still!
Love?
Give it to me!!!
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
I can't.
What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!
And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
You finish her - if you feel so much -
No...
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
I tried...
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
You're not lying to me, are you?
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
It's over, I'm telling you...
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
My daughter...
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
Is that bad?
What the hell would you call this?
Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.
Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
No.
Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
I know it, and it feels good.  Hi, Ty.
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
Some.
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
They never found the body.
Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
What do we do?
Come on, you can make it.
Can't what?
This weekend?
Will you try...for me, please?
Wait, it's Nancy --
It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.
It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
It's in my room!
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
Honey, some folks just can't fly.
We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
Rio, baby!
Why?
Hello?
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
How's Julie?
Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
The rest of us see bathrobes.
Must have missed the sign.
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
That staggering. His dying so quickly.  In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently —— walked blindly.
In case you do so, would you --
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
They used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. Some still do --
Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
Poor Cathy --
If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
Thea is an orphan.
But one must love a father.
I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now —- I don't know ——
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in —- entombed —— imprisoned..
Yes?
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
She's not too well.
Thea?
We have no time for that.
If I told you —— you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you —— the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -—
Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
He hates all my race.
No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it —- he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
I'm hurrying.
Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
Don't . . . George?
Yeah, very funny.
I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.
It isn't me!
No wonder you jumped in the river.
Made what?
Why? Don't they believe in angels?
You're nobody. You have no identity.
Oh, well, I can't . . .
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
That's the kid.
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
What's that book you've got there?
The Building and what?
Oh, look at this. Champagne!
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
Mother . . .
When'd you see him last?
Well, what happened to you?
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
Uh-huh.
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better run along.
Goodbye, Sam.
No charge.
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Aw, get going!
Don't hurt my ear again!
No. No.
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox.  Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come here!
Oh . . .
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
Have a good time, son.
Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there.
What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
You like it? I'll send you a box.
All right, sir.
Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
You may kiss my hand.
Come on, tell me.
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
Have you made up your mind?
Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.
Do you like it?
Well, then, sit down.
Thanks for dropping around.
Yeah, just started.
Sure, sure I am.
Oh, shucks . . .
Hmm? Well, I . . .
Well, I don't know....
Is she responsible for the punch?
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
We're hung up on something.
The Shark.
We'll take your supercargo.
Let's just go sailing, okay?
It's still there!
Aren't you off-duty?
I just made it up.  It means, "Get me out of there."  What the hell's that?
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
In here.
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
Never mind that shit.  Just point.
Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?
Oh, c'mon.
I kind of had plans....
What else you got?
Too late, it's written.
Temporarily?  Uh...sure....
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
Late.
My boss and your boss.  Sure.
In the den.
Terrific.
He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
Are you going to be able to sleep?
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
Just one minute....
Mike's out there.
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
It's still a good idea.
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
Maybe they are!
What?
What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand?  I've seen this sonofabitch before!
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
That's what he said.
You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
Dad!  Dad!
Now I really want to see it.
Waiting for Andy.
I will, I will.
Help!  Help!
Who'd you ask?
The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.
What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right?  Which way are we going?
Anything?
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know....
Is there something I don't know about?
I love it.
Might as well.
When are we going out?  You and me?
You always go with Andy.
Eat Cheerios.
Would you take him?
Len, can I see you a minute?
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
I have to walk him till the drug wears off.
With those camera lights and...
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
It's easy.  Put a net on the derrick.  Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
How many sharks have you killed?
Want another one?
Hope I make it through both.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Don't forget you have your brother.
See you later.
I don't like what he does.
He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
Oh, yeah.  Very.
That we swim.
I talked you into this?
It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
You don't.
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
So tell Calvin.
I can't take water, Kathryn.
It was removed from Charlie Overman's body.
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop.
No!
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
Well, then I'm going to film it.
Make a lovely item for "Good Morning, America"
So do I, love.
Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
Still sleeping.
Thanks for helping.
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
And here I thought I was charming you.
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
They still seem nervous.
Don't blame yourself.
Sure.
... Massachussettans aren't.
Come on!  Check this out!
And alone.
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
Why you sonuvabitch...
What, hon?
He's diving!
Now what?
Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
Aww, can't I keep it?
What the hell's there?
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
No way.
It's not closing, Mike.
... I'll go to McDonalds.
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
We're in love.
That's what grandmas are for.
My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
We forgot to stop at the store.
We need beer....
I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
Because....
But it went away...We would have known....
I don't know....
I'm not on vacation....
I can't help it....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
You caught me....
You have something to say about everything....
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
Stop what?
I'm hungry, Mom....
Adds flavor....
You check it....
A small one...Your brother won't be here....
I won't....
You're silly....
It's not nice to be evasive.
I didn't.
I'm just getting started....
He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....
Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
It's Jake's actually...Our floating lab....
I'm fine....
Mom, please don't start that again....
I'm not going to quit now....
You're not a pain in the ass....
I don't want to talk about that.
No.
Promise me....
It could have been an accident....
Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
I have my own little island.
That's hard to imagine....
You're always taking time off....
Won't you get in trouble...?
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
I'm sorry...I....
I do....
You got a better idea...?
She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it.  We couldn't....
You sure you know how to do this.
The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain....
Tell Thea I'm sorry....
Inch by inch....
She's a tough lady....
Oh, boy....
Will you leave me alone...?
The readings suck....
I made them, man....
May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
It's not a bad life, Jake....
You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
Don't say anything about this to my mother....
When we got the grant....
We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
Lots of times....
Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
I'm going down, Jake....
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
I've got to get to her....
It'll work....
No way....
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....
Don't flatter yourself.... 
Here it comes....
Yes.
What?
You heard. Look for the knife.
Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - <u>this</u> is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months.
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
It's a method for quitting smoking.
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
How'd you do it, old man?
O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
No, you didn't.
Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
To throw out of the window.
You want me to stop the car?
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
You don't really believe this?
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
Bits.
I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
What are you looking for?
Wrong cabinet.
<u>You</u> put it in there.
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
Bullshit.
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
<u>If</u>, your friend from San Diego was up here, and thought for <u>one</u> out of <u>two fucken seconds</u>, she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago ..
I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
No.
Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
Yes.
You should. It's wonderful.
There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
Do you pray?
Which is what?
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
No I'm not.
Why does he want to kill me?
I don't want them to arrest you.
I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.
Yes, Sir.
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..
Two or three years ago.
Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
Ask him.
I know about the bachelor party.
One of the accountants.
That's right.
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
Jerry!  Do something --
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
I see what you're saying.
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
You're imagining it.
Oh, tell the story.
Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
Well, I'm happy for you.
Thanks.
Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
We will be fine!
What you wrote inspired me. _ 79.
Plus, you could use that commission.
You don't have to explain.
I'm relieved you said that.
Bye you guys. _ 88.
Good night.
Same to you.
Right.  I'll come in.
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
You want...
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
Of course I know --
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
Ten seconds, Rod.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
I'll give it everything.
Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
You.
No, I'm saying to be --
Fine.
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
I'm a little worried --
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
Fine.
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
How sad --
I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
Dick.
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
-- and I'll get 'em.
Shut up!!!
And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
What is it?
What?
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
People change.
It’s not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, it’s was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
That one time was just the bumper.
I would completely support that.
Who's that?
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
He loves you too.
I didn't know, there were two islands.
Sure.
It won't hold!
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
I don't think so.
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
Baryonyx?
Raptors, mostly.
The last of my breed.
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
Yeah.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
No we're not.
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
This plane can not land!
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
Back out! Move!
Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --
Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
Not without a shot of the nest.
That was about a year ago.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
Okay.
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
Isn't it obvious?
Operations building.  Far end of the street.
Good.
Oh, God.
Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
She's nuts.
No.
Now's the perfect time.  The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food.  Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
Funded by whom?
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
No.
You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!
Can the kid walk?
Stop the program!  Stop the program!
So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
What now?
How would we cut off the lysine?
Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
Six weeks?
That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... 
Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
What kind of park is it?
The - - agility.  You're right!
Dilophosaurus.
It's my favorite.
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
- - barfs them up - -
Alan!
I don't know.
Why not?
Like hell it is!
I'm still not clear on Chaos.
It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
Please - - chance it.
That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!
No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
I doubt it.
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
You got me.
Occasionally.  Always on the lookout for the future ex- Mrs. Malcolm.
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
Wu?
Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
You're a beautiful big animal.
John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have "thinktelligence."  You think narrowly and call it "being focused."  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.
Wait a minute?  What do you mean "worked"?  Everything is still off!
Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
I'm afraid I am gonna fall!
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
Yeah?
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
Where's Ken? Is he all right?
Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there.
_Krueger_...
Compared to this guy... amateur.
It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
Video store?
He's fucking nuts.
One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.
None of that's true?
You're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
There's a pizza place over on Market.
So what do we do?
How's that possible?
And if he's not?
Let's split up. You take the left side, I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
-- Small.
I don't know what you could have read.
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
An empty tomb?
What an extraordinary request!
Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
You're just doing your job.
Sit down, Kafka.
I do.
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.
Tonight?
And you ...?
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
Usually.
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
-- Listen to me --
I don't know.
No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one.
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
You look tired.
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
Father ... Father!
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
Are you kidding?! That heap of junk will never leave the ground!
Relax ... it was fifteen years ago. I don't do it now.
Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
We're leaving.
Jack!...  Jack!
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
Native costume?
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten!
Please, if he sees you, he won't come!
What about him? Yes.
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --
You've spent your life avoiding this. You'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it.
Don't belong?
You think people hate you.
Yes.
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
I said yes, I see.
Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
How would I remember?
-- OK --
I don't see anything, do you?
Well --
Yeah, you got to me.
-- Then you don't need me.
How?
Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
Why?
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
My bed.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
OK.
Can you use these?
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
It's got to make sense some way.
How is it back there?
Well as a matter of --
Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
She told me.
Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
Did she talk about him to you?
Has she talked with you since prison?
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
Nobody's seen that.
Yes sir, we know he --
Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --
Not particularly.
Detroit.
Greatest...
On earth.
You got a letter from mom.
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
I'm allergic to onions.
No.  This is fine.  Just take a bite, you'll like it fine.
That's okay, pal.  Go back to sleep.  It's very late.
Uh huh?
Good night.
You like it?
Yeah, there was apple juice.
I don't understand, daddy.
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
No, I did not.
Yes.  Very much.
Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
No.
No.
No.
I suppose...
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
Yes.
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
So do you.
He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.
I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
What?!?
I don't believe you.
Murray.
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
But it's not a year from now, is it?
You've got that look.  My lady and I split two years ago in August and I'm an old pro at this shit.  First thing, stay away from the Children's Zoo.  It's pure hell--if I never see another chicken, I'll be happy.  I'm here, darling.  Don't worry...
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
Fine.
When Joanna--  my ex-wife--when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage...Well, I guess most of what she said was probably true.  There were a lot of things I didn't understand-- a lot of things I would do different if I could.  Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change...But we can't.  Some things, once they are done, can't be undone.  Joanna says she loves Billy.  I believe she does.  So do I.  But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue.  The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy...When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose she's right.  But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex?  I guess I've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent:
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
It's going to cost.
How the hell are you going to do that?
No.
Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
Do not worry, Holiness. They fight for you. They are under your protection.
And you have horses? You love horses.
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
General Chiang.
Yes.
He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
How many?
Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.
Please.
Roughly five thousand men.
No. Not very big.
When it is time.
Ask whatever you will.
Can India help us?
Britain?
Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have.
Thank you.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
You decide.
I have smarter men.
You cannot.
I would not know. Maybe.
I will miss you.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
We cannot.
How could I ever leave?
It is possible, Holiness.
What would you do, Holiness?
I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
Oh, yes.
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
Mr. Cyr!
They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
I coulda shot you, you--
They don't really attack underwater and--
Yup.
You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
I never had sex with you!
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
Are you sure?
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
They could try to tranq him on land.
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
I <u>told</u> you.
Who?
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
Good.
Good.  See ya soon.
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
You're mushing it a little around the--
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
You wouldn't?
Take him.
You wanna ride in my truck?
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
Good thinking.
Let's go.
Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
You too.
Is the dead guy in there?
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
I thought I saw...
Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 
He said he knew Karate!
What?
She's worried about the cow now.
Kevin, hey.
A jerk.
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
Kelly--
Part of our research--
It has nothing to do with--
<u>Kelly</u>--
Backstabber?
Never cock. Just squeeze.
Thanks, Ardelia.
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
Sometimes.
I will... I promise.
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
The market in Lecter hints is way down, today, okay? I've got two good men dead in Memphis, and three civilians. I've got -
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
Let's get some coffee and talk.
Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
Maybe they'll catch up.
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day.
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
Because you weren't wasting my time.
That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
Who killed your patient?
What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
Yes, Doctor. Please.
No. We just -
All right, then tell me how -
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
Well that is to be expected. My father...
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
Sorry to disappoint you...
I have nothing to go back for.
There was no letter.
Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?
What the bloody hell plan is this?
Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
No.
Do not let gratitude get in the way...
I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
Do you hear me, sir!  If you ever fall... into British hands...  What white water?
This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
That's all, sir.
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
Webb's at Edward?
General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
Atten-hut!
Fire!
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.
Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
What has?
Were, Doss <u>were</u>.
Can you fix it?
No.
How do you know it was Williams?
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Has it helped?
Seeing how my stock's doing...
Where's Doc?!
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
Charge set.  Backing off.  C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
And it killed Bo?
Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
Do it.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.
The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
Hook's on 24...
Itches like hell.
What music?  There ain't no music.
He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
I'm going to kill it!
It's had a meal.
Like a leech.
The good doctor signed our death warrant.
She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
Seven hundred for the pair.
It's hit us all hard!
I still will, if you don't mind.
And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know.
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.
There were two old guns there; where are they?
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
Just carrying a bag.
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
All right, Kenny.
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
The stupid bastards! Count it!
No.
Just give me the keys.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
What the fuck is going on?
Get the sodding gate open now, Plank.
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.
Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.
A hundred grand.
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
Do you want me to draw a picture?
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
At what, exactly?
That's going on optimism.
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
Er, well, twelve.
We need fertilizer, Winston.
What do you mean?
So?
They stole our land--
I can fix cars.
Yes, sir--
The--the officers.
No, sir. Not at all.
He'll live.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
He swore by it.  What?
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
I roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy Herrera."
You're fired. You're outta the department.
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
No sir.
But they were Indians themselves.
You know who I am?
By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
You own this place?
Lead mine.
It's a lead mine.
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--
What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
They were using M-1's, yeah--
We should just do it.
You know who it was they dug up?
Pleased to meet you.
I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
I have some friends who have had a accident--
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
We made our collection at Roderick's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him.  He went missing the next day, along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail.
--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
Seems like we have another one every week.
She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
Hey, Sam.
Buddy Deeds--
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
Steve?
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
He's going to wish he was dead.
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
That was the night he disappeared?
What was your deal with him?
For a while.
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
Nothing.
Two years.
Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
Well, it's a complicated issue--
You don't need to cuff me.
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
Sure.
Name's Otis.
Payne.
Runnin' numbers illegal.
Been away. Up to Houston.
You heard right.
doorway) And who's that?
All right.  It was...
He won't.
About?
What about death?
I could scoop them out.
I swear... this is the place Swann told me about.  The rocks...
It's him... it's him.
It was me.
Why did you wait so long?
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
Yes...
Yes...
He's with us... He's with us...
Yes.
You don't?
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
That's my business. Harry.
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
It's okay.
Hang on!
I... have... to.
I'm okay.  I'm okay.
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
Somebody killed him.
I just saw him.
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
--vanished.
So could you walk on water?
I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
Maybe I just bought it.
Yes.
A Mister Quaid?
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
Have you been in?
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
It's me betrayed him.
I don't know what else to do.
And he didn't have them?
Yes.
Looks that way.
Yes?
I don't know.
And he's dead?
Yes.
Yes.
No!
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
I'm here for the week.
Hi, Charlie.
It's Charlotte.
Do you want to have some breakfast?
I see them every morning.
Yeah, you don't remember?
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
We established that we have no communication.
Because that would be too easy.
No.
You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
That lunch was the worst, huh.
That's what you said the other night.
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
Yes, no.
Oh?
Ok, well... I love you.
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
Fine. Is it going ok?
Ok.
Bye.
Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
One moment, please.
Bye.
Ok, I will... later.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
Hmmm.
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
I found the pentacle.
So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.
Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
Yes.  It's exactly...
What time did you make it for?
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
Yes.  We won, that's right.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
What's his name?
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
I'm going to look around.
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
I see things.  My worst fears.  You need to know something, Peter.  I was possessed once.  Like Birdson.  It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
What did he say to you in French?
And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
It's Detective Smythe.
There weren't any voices.
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
How're you doin' today?
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Need any help?
To that stewardess?
Don't curse.
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
But you use potato?
You're a caterer?
I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me?  Dora, take her spot.
Thanks.
Four days.
Why not?
To do what you love.
No.
He's in college?
You lost your head.
Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
Just one word of advice for next season.
I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
Kay.
For how long?
And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
What?
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
Yeah.
I said fine.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.
You're not stupid.
Quincy...
What's up?
Here I am.
It happens, right...
Not really.
Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.
What the hell's going on?
So you fucked around to prove a point!
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
I'm not asking for us to be together.
Kiss my ass.
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
Maybe go back to school.
We need to talk.
So you're gonna bitch up?
Hey.
Well, can you give him this for me?
I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
What's that, not great?
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
You came out early.
What mess?
Tell me what?
We need to talk.
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.
Brain and Lung.
It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
GET OUT.
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
-- do you wanna cup?
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
Okey-doke.
We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
Well...is that illegal?
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
ok.
Can I tell you something?
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
What?
please, what is it, please --
You mind if I come in, check things?
Claudia.
Sure, why?
Cynthia?
I should maybe go to the bathroom.
-- Richard.
If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
Son, don't --
-- no.
Son, please, now....
Please, boy, put it down and it's ok.
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
No.
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
Braces.
Don't do this, Don.
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
Where is he?
Yeah.
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
It's ok.
Graduation?
Twelve.
Hi.  Is Frank there?
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
Mm. Hm.
An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
Go ahead and waste your time.
Around here.
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
Not a problem.
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
...are you Phil...?
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
yeah.
No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here?
And what about screaming?
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
For 25.  Best known for the "tragedy and blood" genre, this author-playwright --
Jean Baptiste Poquelin Moliere.
It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
Will that help?
Yes.
How long with Paula?
Maybe...I don't...
Do you know the answer to this?
Did you ever touch her?
I don't know.
I really don't know.
Yes.  What's your name?
Not as much as I used to.  Ever since we started, I haven't really gone in to school that much because I've been getting more and more auditions --
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
Shut the fuck up.
Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
Hi.
...I don't....
-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
Water.
What do you do?
Shut up -- shut up --
-- the fuck are you talking about?
Love you too.
Sure.
I didn't know the answer --
Stand up.
Yes.
Go to bed.
It's not right.
I have money.
I have money to give you.
M'lady...?
Nothing... Nothing.
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
How goes that favor I asked of you?
Replace the king.
Making the key to the throne.
A body.
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
Three days??!!
Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
So what has changed?
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.
You can't do it.
I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.
Catacombs.  Very holy.
I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.
Who?
Perhaps this will help.
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.
No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.
I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
How did you know -- ?
If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you.
Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
It shall be done, your Majesty.
They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will!
There.
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
Thank you, Keeper.
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
Sire, I --
Raoul... is in love...
Yeah?
Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
What do you need?
So what?
Where are you?
You set to go -
we've got kidnapping, grand theft auto, burglary, and two counts of murder on you, and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!
Don't worry -
I didn't hit shit!
Did you start out area six?
What?
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
And who are you?
Did he harm the girl?
Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
Yeah?
Seattle.
You're the mysterious type, right?
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
No -
Please...
This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
Not with this...
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
That was Peterson upstairs.
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
What's the bottom line?
Could he handle a direct contact?
Library of Congress.
Read it.
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
What else did you keep out of the papers?
No other possibilities?
See? You do know something about him.
Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
You.
After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
That's narrow?
You wanna watch this or what?!
Don't talk to me!!
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
It'll do fine.
I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...
I have work to do at the plant.
Are you okay...?
Me.
The Tooth...
No.
No!
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
I don't want to know.
I'm very scared.
Yes.
Not me.
God, no.
Yeah. It's right here.
I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
Thank you very much.
Why do you think I called?
Cut the general crap.
That's true.
Goodbye.
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
He only bit women so far, right?
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
Tell me about yourself.
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
Blue, then.
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
No.
I have to go back to Birmingham.
That's not true.
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Yeah...
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
You read about it, I'm sure.
I thought you would have some ideas.
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
You're insane.
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
That's interesting.
I haven't decided yet.
What do you want?
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
Yes.
You got it.
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
George, I hate sitcoms.
I refuse.
Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.
No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
So who's gonna pay for it?
Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
DON'T TOUCH ME!
Then your father's a wimp.
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!
No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
Yes, your Holiness?
It is apparently not working.
Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
Why isn't he MOVING??
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
Hurry!
What?
Should Tank I.D. it?
Right...
I know but I felt like taking a shift.
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
An accident?!
You killed them.
My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
No!
Sorry.
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
They'll be able to track it.
Five minutes.  Maybe six.
Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
But what if...?
How do you know all this?
The Matrix?
What truth?
You've never used them before.
For what?
Your mind makes it real.
I think I do.
Of the Resistance.
Morpheus, I don't know --
I need the main wet-wall.
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
Yes, sir.
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
How do you know that name?
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
It's going into replication.
Easy, Neo.  Easy.
It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
I'm going in after him.
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
I believe I can bring him back.
Yeah?
I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving.
Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.
Depends on the mind.  But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.
Because I believe in something.
Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
Kick it in!  Kick it in!
Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
You sure?
Well the guy over there said...
Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
Uh...can we give you a check?
'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
She don't look Jewish.
Yeah.
And say what?
Thanks for the ride.
Not quite...but keep trying.
Giovanino!  Where have you been?
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
Should I slap him?
Wouldn't bother me.
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
How?
Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
You tell me that in front of these creeps?
Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
No you're not...
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
Mind your own business.
Forget it.
Good idea.
That bad, huh?
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
We'll be here.
I know.
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
Oh...around...why?
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
What is it now?
CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
Not sick...just stupid.  Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
Well you can't blame them in a way.
Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
 Shut up.
Sal!... fourteen street.
This is some boat.  Your father's?
Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
You what?
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Sure.
You ate?
And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
He's cute.
Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
'Goddam party'!
But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
But what?
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy.  But miles ahead of Peter Pan.  Like a taste?
Right away.
What 'business'?
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
Am I not obligated to?
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
Here...
Thank you.
Cold.
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
A voice?
'Yes' to the deal?
Did you just hear something?
Do you think I need a haircut?
Me, too.
What do you mean?
I am now.
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --
Yours.
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
Thanks, Quince.
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
Yes.
Mine, too.
You loved back?
Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
What?
Yes?
It's so very nice to see you again.
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
But she loves you?
I'm lost.
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
Do you love Drew?
I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
I don't have any.
Yes?
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
Not now.
It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
Gay?
-- I guess you haven't.
It was everything.
Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
How beautiful.
I loved it.
I love you in an evening gown.
Yes, that's why I said it.
Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
Good morning, Bill.
What do you mean?
Of course.
Not this.
That's what everybody says.
No.
No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
That's okay.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
Not at all.
I was just asking, Bill.
Say again?
I'll take it from here --  I am --
That's life.  What can I tell you?
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
Of course.
I believe you did.
I'm sorry, I --
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
I'm doing great.  You ready?
Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.  Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.
The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
Does Drew tell you everything?
Probably.
That's all?
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
Bravo.
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
Will it?...
Joe?
I don't know.
I don't understand.
I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
You and 'Honey'?
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
From what?
Just loud enough to wake me up.
Seen you together, that's all.
Why?
Just two. So far.							  *
A cop?
* I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
Thanks.
Interested in buying one?
I forget.
I don't want blood on them.
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
Yes.
Kill him.
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.
Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.
And what did he say?
Yeah?
I told him about your car.
He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
Somebody's come. Already.
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
Can I ask you something?
* John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *
Thank you.
What?
What do you want?
Did Teddy send you?
I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
You said you were leaving town.
Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
Shut it, Teddy.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
Why not?  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
Why are you following me?
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
Just some guy. Does it even matter who? I stopped asking myself why a long time ago. No reason, no conspiracy; just bad fucking luck. A couple of junkies, too			 * strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. When you killed him,			* I've never seen you so happy - I was convinced you'd remember. But it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick.
Lemon or lime?
Turn around.
Then that's it.  Change the mission statement. Crockett stays in.  He keeps working up the ladder.  The local importers get a pass for the time being.
They may have already, so we protect the living.  Proof she's alive?
Recruit us to do what?
José Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
Yes you do...
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
And what is that?
I'm a fiend for mojitas.
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
Died in childbirth, having me...
Cost less.  That's the point.
What do you mean?
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.
And what do I do with him?
Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
It says, "We do not fear you."  It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..."
We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
What happened to the last transporter you <u>had</u>?
Who knows...
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
No.
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
Chill out Sonny.
Twenty on my man...
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
This is Agent James Fujima.
From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
Alonzo, what's goin' on?!
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
But what does your intuition tell you...?
A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
What would you do...?
Define small.
Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
They lied.
Men, they mostly faggots.
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
Sure you're all right?
No. Of course not. Just something struck me funny...
Y -- what in hell starts with Y?
For money for what?
How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.
What's that supposed to mean?
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
Can he smell the difference, eh?
What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.
No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.
I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule.
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
Gonna be like money from home.
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
Getchmis...?
History, man, history. How much?
Stop shitting me, man!
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
Well, it's an interesting place...  Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.
Ah, look!  they probably know where the campers are
Good.  Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him?
But just...
Something like that. Cigarette?
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
That doesn't seem so bad.
Hello.
What's that?
Where is it?
Yeah.
Two thirty.
After we're outside the kogus?
ZIAT... What do I got to lose huh! What do I got to lose. And I'd really enjoy it.
Max - where?
Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
Who?
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
New York's finest.
Mole people. This section was pretty popular, all the way to Fulton Street...
Right.
Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
Those things bring juice to the new stations.  You just can't rewire that shit...
Just do it!
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
What?
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
Manny...
Please.
Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
We're down to a "couple" now, huh?
Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
So?
I heard how you talked to him.
Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
Ah...
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
She used a baster.
I know.  Help me get a sample.
What are they...?
And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done. 
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
Nothing.
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
I can live with "great."
You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
Yeah, thanks.
Perfect.
Yes.
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
Great.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
I'm telling you, I can't.
Have to wait.
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
It's perfect.
Maybe.
You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.
You don't know?
You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses.
There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
What thing?
He's your client, huh?
So do I...
I'm sure you're right.
Buster.
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
You're still a writer.
That'd be a first.
Great.
Not possible..
From her point of view or mine?
Sean, please..
In the envelope in my pocket.  My right.. jacket..pocket..
I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
Well that depends.
How do you that.
What else?
Then don't say it.
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
And you're happy about that?
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt.  from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me.  Ball's in your court, Hunt.  What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer.
I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.
Right.
We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
How much longer before you can reach him?
Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
No.  Should I?
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
- torque wrench.
Listen to what?
Your help?  What are you talking about?
Ethan Hunt.
Damn, you're beautiful.
Can you think of a better one?
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?
Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Why did you phrase it like that?
You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
By fire.  That's the best way, really.
You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
That simple, huh?
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
Nyah still on the property?
I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.
Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds.
Do I?
Yes, Anatoly, yes.
Now we donít have to eliminate him?  You like that, donít you Claire?  Donít you?
May take a little time.
We got it.  On your feet.
Talking's good, walking's better.
I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
What happened to Jim?
Take off your God damn coat!
Who is they, who is they?
I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.
Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
Sure...
You don't think we're going to make it.
Is this the only way?
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know
One hour.
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
Profitable.
You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
About what?
Like Job?
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
Let's move!
Bank?
Where exactly is it?
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Why?
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?
We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
<u>Negative</u>, Golitsynís on the move.
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
Yeah.
I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Iím dead and gone.  God knows what sheís had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
And get a doctor.
Ethan - Iíve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you.
Jack...that's spying.
And a lonely ass.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
Twenty minutes.
Connection denied.
I always check the batteries.
No, I'm going.
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going.  You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
What?
Thank you, Rose.
I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
Ti amo.
Again?
You did this once it didn't work out.
What killed him?
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
I didn't give you away the first time.
What'd you do to your hair?
Alright. I didn't see you here.
And what did they say?
They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess.
He's in Palermo.
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
Bus hit him.
Why what?
I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
I'm telling you your life!
Because I have no Luck!
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
What?
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
She didn't like me.
You ruined my life.
Oh no I didn't!
I can't do that!
I'm in love with you!
I can't!
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
I wanna go home.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
I know what I know.
No.
Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Is Johnny here?
She was too young for him.
Never is a long time.
I don't understand.
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
You've made me very happy, Johnny.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
I must ask for that back.
And who's gonna pay for that?
I got married before, you didn't sell.
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
Sure!
It's nothing!
I'm not disturbed. By you.
Will you join me for dinner?
Don't shit where you eat.
I think it's because they fear death.
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
Sure.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
I'm too old for you.
Good night.
Oh.
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
I knew she had it.
What do you mean?
The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
NI!   NI!
We want ... a shrubbery!
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
What?
Come on you pansy!
Had enough?
Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
That's it.  Ni!  Ni!
What does it say?
It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
Oh, just some friends!
I am an enchanter.
Quite.
A G...g...g...
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
What?
It is the rabbit.
Well ... I AM king.
Shut up!
And the hat.  But she is a witch.
To find the Holy Grail.
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
Oh ... that's awfully nice.
But, Mother ...
Listen, Alice ...
Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
Got it?
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
No ... just keep him in here.
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
No, It's nothing!
Camelot ...
We'll cover your escape!
We must examine you.
Back to your bed!  At once!
You got my note!
You've come to rescue me?
He's come to rescue me, father.
Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
I can't let her down now, Archie.
Get out.  Out!
I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit.  The room ... You don't have to stay.
I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
Kitchen and lower house.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
Quite.
Out of my way!
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
It is quite late enough.
My own.
We --
That's not good enough.
Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard.  In the event of any disturbance I will ensure --
I am a blank sheet.
Occasionally.
This is the top.
What I do, I do for my Queen.
She's well, too.
I'm glad of it.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
Who by?
What does he know about the Highlands?
What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
To keep out the cold.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
Have I ever let you down before--?
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
The question is, do we need her?
My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.
What is he doing there?
I understand he was in a fight.
Why?
What is it?
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  But what can I do for you?
If I tell you, then it's no fun.
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
He?
And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
What the hell does that mean?
Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
I came from the city on the left.
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
It's already out.
And beat it at it's own game.
Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
We're actually inside, aren't we?
What?!  There's nothing here!
Screamer.
And then keep on driving?
That way.
Is that your question?
You have no time.  What is your question?
You have no time.
Who fired everyone?
No.
I know.  Where are you Adam?
You're broke!
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
I'll speak to someone.
No problem. What's on your mind?
Sure.
One.
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
Yes.
Very pleased to meet you.
Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
No. I can't.
May I have your name please?
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
Oh...
Mulholland Drive?
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
Do you know them?!
And who are we auditioning for today?
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
Oh boy.
Could be unrelated.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
Making ends meet, huh.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
No time. Get him up.
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.
Knows ? He watches every "Guest" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
Not listening !
I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
You don't. It's random, there no trick.
I work here, remember ?
Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?
Hey , Hey !
Not quite....
A dragon.
Are you hunting wabbits ?
What the fuck are you talking about.
Don't have to tell me twice.
What ?
Yes, sir Mom. 
Got it.
When will that be ?
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?
He probably has a history of this shit.
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...
I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.
Yes sir.
That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
What do you mean sir ?
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
Better, sir.
Sir ?
What did you hear ?
I was.
No I am not.
Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
I don't know.....
Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.
Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is not the wardrobe of choice tonight. I'm quite confident that my tie is looking better than yours.
He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece.
What happened ?
Yes.
As appealing as that sounds...
Yes, Excuse me for a second.
Wake up, we're in trouble.
Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
Zach from work ?
Are you writing a poem?
Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
Me, I'll know!
What do you remember about her.
Suspended from school, my mother??
I'm leaving Sunday.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Seriously?
Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
She just had a baby that's all.
Then I'll throw up a little bit.
Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.
Yes I know, it runs in the family.  New book?
Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think...
I was pushing as fast as I could.
Oh.  Ohhh?
You mean, you knew about me?
Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
He likes you.
I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!
Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.
Hi.
Then I have come to the right place.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
Give it back Nicholas!
What ever happened to a good old-fashioned favor huh?
I won't.
You're so clever.
Yeah, RIGHT.
TAXI!!!
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
What difference does it make?
What if you don't wanna be found?
Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
He is one of the great poets.
And I thought I was weird.
Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.
DON'T, come on!!!
In the tar??
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
What do you think?
This is a totally barbaric custom.
He's an undertaker.
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
Part adventure...part miracle.
Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
Committed.
I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
Phil for God sake.
Oh...what's that?
Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.
I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
Hey! Oh look.
I know, look at his little hands.
O.K.
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
I'm impressed.
No.
I think it's still available.
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
Yes they are.
You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
It's no big deal.
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
Okay, sure.
Yes.
Goodnight.
Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise.....
Perfect.
O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
You never cared before.
Can I go too?
Sorry.
Soon honey, soon.
I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
Feeding my fish.
No, no.
That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.
Nothing, I'm dressing.
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
Will you tell her I came by?
I wrote a poem too.
Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
We'd love to hear it.
You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
Mostly love, and romance.
Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other.
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
No.
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
Aarrggh.
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I'm eleven and a half.
I will I promise.
I'm allergic to it.
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
It's my mother.
What?
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
Don't DO that!!
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
What?
Leave then, some friend you are.
But, I don't know how.
But then I won't be able to see anything.
Would you think of me?
Part of being a New Yorker.
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
... weeks.
Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
We're about to find out.
You have a real philosophy of life.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
You've been working on this, huh?
And you believe that.
Someday she'll thank you.
Try less appropriate.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
To belong to someone.
Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...
Well, we're...
Which was the disqualifying factor?
He said that, too.
... cigars in bed? I broke him on that.  But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
... whatever is manly and independent.
Hello.
He won't get mad, huh?
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
Don't you see...
... that this is all my fault?
I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
Nobody has.  So far.
I need you.
Such as.
She finds him "personable."
Till the gas ran out.
What, leaving school...
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
Like I said, dazzling.
I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.
The night we met.
Yes.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
You're right.  Easy come, easy go.
It means a lot.
A bad combination.
I just want to be alone.  Is that okay?
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
She admits it's her fault.
Shhh.
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?
What is that sup...
Right here.
Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
I see.
What's wrong honey.
Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.
Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
You'll have to speak up.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
She's going to rest now.
Oh, sure.
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
Well, I just thought I'd call.
Who the hell is he?
What does he want?
Okay.
President.
Sure thing.
Sue was trying to get hold of you.
The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.
Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
What is a turkey shoot.
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Sure he will.
What did you say?
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
Does their hair fall out?
No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
I've got a gig tonight.
What?
What...?  0h, yes.
Yea.
I'm sorry but I have to go.
You sound different. Is that really you?
Hundreds of times.
Hello.
Might be good for you.
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Did it break?
Why?
Where is she?
We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
Where are you from?
You always live there?
Who?
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
I'll be dammed.
Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
Is that good?
You think I should take lessons?
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.
Yes, they were.
Yes, you are.
What...
It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.
Don't stop!
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
Thank you, sir.
I see.
How's it goin'?
She was born without a tongue.
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
How 'bout Manson?
She doesn't talk?
She sings? What does she sing?
Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
Okay, let's cut it.
Yeah, we have a van.
So, what now?
No. Not really.
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
I do, too.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
Yes.
Survival of the fittest.
Just for fun, I guess.
They actually apologized.
Where do the air ducts lead?
Next week's episode.
Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.
Rockin'!
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
How 'bout Mallory?
Would the network really not run it without the interview?
Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Really?
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
See Duff. He's the money man.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
What d'you think?
Don't start no trouble, boy!
What did you say your name is?
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
Thanks.
Guess I don't.
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
That ain't my idea of friendliness.
Okay.
Oh yeah?
No. I'm new in town.
You work around town?
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
That's right.
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
Are you married?
Four.
I thought you wasn't comin'.
He could live with us.
Am I as good as they?
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
I keep thinking about him.
Yeah.
They won't.
What're you going to do?
Watch out!
Take it easy, Frankie.
How 'bout the key?
Like what?
Who're you?
Great.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
Sure.
That's right.
How are you?
Thank you.
I understand.
I know.
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
Right here.
Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
Of course.
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
Why not?
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
What are you talking about?
Are you even really alive?
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
How are we doing?
I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
Less than thirty minutes.
It's coming.
I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
Case.
No!... No...
This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
What's that supposed to mean?
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
Put the gun down, Case.
Give me five minutes.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
What went down between you and Riviera?
I know you have. C'mere.
No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
We've still got to find the mainframe.
What is it?
Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
Nice.
Yeah. Let's do that.
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
Thanks.
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
Yeah.
I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
Anita, remember espadrilles?
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
Just get in the van, Josie.
Sometimes opposites attract.
Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?
Why?
Do I want to be crunched?
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
Have you been there?
Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
They hid my car--
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
See!
Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
I can't do this.
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
Sorry. Forgetful.
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
Thank you.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
Don't look down!
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Thanks. So do you.
Why?
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
Maybe we should sit.
Everybody knows about--
We can handle it.
For this.
Just what?
But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
No.
<i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
<i>                      Shut up and listen...!</i>
What are you talking about?
Ken!
Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!
What about it?
Yeah, why?
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
Only the wet ones.
Shut up, Grady.
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
I know.
Uh-uh.  Before my time.
Who?
I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!
I don't know.  Where are we going?
Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room?  Fred Krueger worked here.  It's an old power- plant - a steam generator!
About what?
Ghostbusters are fearless.
There's nothing to figure out.
What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
No.  I'm okay.
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
I thought I'd wait for you.
They're healing up nicely.
Watching TV.
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
He's too strong!  He was never this strong!
What?
A little basic, but nice.
Why is that?
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
It's been a long time.
You know what he did.  He's doing it again.
Call me Nancy.
Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
With Hypnocyl?
So do I.
I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.
For what?
There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.
Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
No...
Your dreams?
Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
Neil, please --
Mary Helena.
For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
This is stupid.
Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."
And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.
Now you're lying.
Night, night, Honey.
I'm not listening.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Well, they can be.
Here, let me help.
Really, no.
Oh -- Okay.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
Okay.
That's fine.
Step aside.
She saw through me.
No, you were brilliant
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
You have a stunt bottom?
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
What?
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
How do you think I'm doing?
Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
I haven't decided.
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
And this is William.
Right. 
It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
Is Miss Scott staying here?
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
Working with Leonardo.
Di Caprio.
Me?
It was good.
Blimey.  What's that?
This is Henry James film?
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
Is it someone we know?
I believe I have.
May I help you, sir?
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Point taken.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Two?  That's it?
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
What?
No, 'fraid not.
I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
And she's in your house.
And you get on very well.
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Yes.
So?
No, Miss Ratched...
Mister Washington.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes.
Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
No, it was irresponsible!
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
Yes, Miss Ratched...
B-B-Billy.
What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
C-C-Come here and l-look at th this!
Good boy, thank you, Billy.
P-p-p-please duh-duh-duh-duh t-t tell, M-M-M-Miss R-R-Ratched, y-y you don't need to!
No.
Wow! They're so quiet.
Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.
Right, Mack!
Hey, what's that?
I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
Huh?
Me, too...
My feet hurt...
Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
With your own two hands?
Just warmin' up.
What for?
Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
I refuse!
No!
I just started!
Gary Blinker...
Yeah, it's cold!
Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
We'll let you know.
Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!
What's the horse pill for, honey?
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
Are you a doctor?
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
I'm not going back in there. I told ya this was a one way trip. Now stand aside.
Gimme those dice. I'll blow this board to pieces. Here we go...  Lebenty leben, count me over eleven, Martini...
You's better believe it, brother!
Okay. How you doing?
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
How's your ass been holdin' up, honey?
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Big man!
Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
After you, ma'am.
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
Bet you ass...
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am...  A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am...
Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...
That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
Why?
--separate, in the evening..."
Yes.  We did.
Your great aunt.
Dwayne?
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
Amazing.
Hm.
I'm at the airport.  Why?
I'm in love with you.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
Yes.
No, that wasn't a lie.  That was...  a mirage.
Because I don't have the right name?!
Because.  I know where he is.
He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
Tell me.
Please.  I need to know.
Right now?
What are you doing here?
The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
Yeah.
No.  Course not.
You aren't?
I can't believe you did that!
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
You would?  Really?
What?
Oh.
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
So, what's your point?
Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
Is he married?
He's a podiatrist or something.
No.  He's never asked me.
Yes you did.
I know.  You're right.
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
It's a coincidence.
Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 
My God, you have...
What'd you find?
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
Nothing.
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
Her brother.
I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
Sure you did.
Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
...and a fortune teller.
You sure you'll be okay?
He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
Yes.  He is.
Uh huh.
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
And Larry?...
I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
You miss me?...
I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
He missed me.
Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
You know Johnny when he gets mad.
So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this— a deal I sweated and bled for— on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?—
Gimme.
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
He was always a good kid. You know that.
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
Then don't.
This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?
Maybe he gave them an argument.
It's a living.
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
Maybe.
Yeah— yeah— I guess I do— but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
I could have been better!
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
Okay— I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but— go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
Man, you were a mess!
How would you've done it?
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
Listen— get this straight— don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
Edie— it's—
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
I mean it, let's get away from here, first Joey then Nolan, now Charley— and any minute... .  ...I'm frightened— I'm frightened.
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
You are like—
Let me by.
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
You go to hell.
Are you on the level, Father?
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
Raise a hand to me and... .
You'd be off the pier for good.
Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
First things first.
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
Now just a minute, I—
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a walkin' distillery.
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
It frightens me.
Then..then what's that music?
It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
I'm not sure...
Of course I do.
It would seem so, Master.
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
Is there time?
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
And the one driving the other car?
Who is it?
No, thanks.
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.
Really.  Hm.
Thank you.
Yes.
His assistant.
Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
You're right.
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
Now you're talkin'.
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
Yes, she did.
Whatta you wanna do?
And who watches your back?
I don't ski.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
And then they'll kill 'em.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
In the trunk, yeah?
Is that what you would've done?
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
You're gonna use a ram?
The manager's door is metal.
What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
Excuse me, Adele?
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
I don't smoke.
Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.
I thought everything.
Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
Not until recently.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
Uh-huh.
Bleeding on a country road.
Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
Really.  He has a cop's face.
Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
Because you're having too much fun.
Love it.
I don't have a problem with it.
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
That's not what you were about to say.
You believe that?
I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare me.
Yeah?  She said that to you?
I don't know...
You know who they are?
Any time.
I don't know.  I never used a gun.
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
Hejira.
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.
You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts.
I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
I <i>was</i>...
You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.
You a lawyer?
What did you call it?
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
He's still married though, huh?
Then they're not separated, are they?
Huh.
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
So?
I don't have any idea.
The combination is three-ten-forty-four.
Yeah, as soon as we got back.
I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
Ten gees.
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
Only when I'm n-n-n-
Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
Sir?
Where's that lizard?
You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.
Come on!
Home of the brave.
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
Longer?  It's getting shorter.
The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
The second wave has not returned.  And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
We've done studies.  We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.
God help them.
Good—bye, Grandma.
This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
On what?
Just what you underlined.
That's disgusting!
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
I know. Put Scott through college.
Oh yeah?
Maybe I blocked it out.
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
What am I going to do with you?
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
I just can't trust you anymore.
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
How'd you know about that?
Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
That's real big of you.
Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
You're going to listen to me.
You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
Of course.
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
I'll just set it right here.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
What, why?
But I'm remembering the future.
My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
It must run in the family.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
What?
Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
At my age? Don't be silly.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
Doing some shopping?
This morning was good.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
How do you feel?
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
For what?
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
I'm just happy to see you.
You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
Are you doing some kind of science project?
Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
I	know what a burrito is.
What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
Richard, take it easy.
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
High tech. I like the sound of that.
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
Did you break up with Charlie?
I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
How'd you know that?
Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
Sure.
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
All set.
Anywhere but here.
Is he gonna be okay?
Just until he heals up?
I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
Yeah...
Maybe it takes a while...
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
All the time.
Right here, Mom...
Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
In a word, Bob...
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
K-R-O-one.
Because they deserve to, Walter.
What's that on your forehead, pal?
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
I am relaxed.
You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
I promise!
Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
That's not what I said.
No sweat, buddy.
More than your friend. Family.
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
One week old.
Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it.  What can I do for you?
Continue.
Continue.
Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap.  It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done.
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
What?
Rayisha. Very nice.
They didn't fire her?
Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
Let's review these notes for your testimony. We have a big day on Monday.
Do you... pray?
What happens?
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
You're ready, don't worry.
What kind of person is that?
I suppose you could say that.
Yes. On my torso.
Sure thing.
In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
I guess it was 1984, 85.
I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
That's right.
One. Here, in front of my ear.
Thank you.
Yes.
What did you say?
Thank you. No more questions.
Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
Why are we going to do that?
Right.
Get real.
That's correct.
Aren't you?
Not especially.
Fine, Joe.
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
Any women on board?
By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
You had one guy "like that?"
Dr. J.!
We ought to be suing him.
Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
<u>What</u>?
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
Entered our minds.
Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive.  Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed.
We can, can't we? Trust you?
We can't make it.
Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
Not sure. Ten?
Hey, who?
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
For your own fear.
79 kilos.
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
Company's not here, is it?
Riddick?
What?
And what about the cells?
KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
About the girl.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
Just wanted his O-2.  Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.
What, it's broken?
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
You still don't believe me, do you?
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
What signal?
long pause) You know it.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
Try telling them our names.
Zira doesn't want your female.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
He wouldn't leave her.
Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
With one of them.
Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
Then you admit --
Listen, listen -- I can speak --
Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
Yes.
Maybe not.
You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.
Taylor, you can't.
God bless you.
Like you, I find it difficult.
This is his assertion.
YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move.
Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.
Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.
Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.
You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
...don't feel like it either.
Who gives a shit!
Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.
Sounds like it.
You know what I'm talking about!
That's what he is... Baaaa!
Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
I'm sure you have.
How careful should I be?
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
No, please.
I see.
I see.
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
Quarter after one. Why?
Is this the best you can do?
Dance? Here?
Absolutely sure.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
And Betty Mayfield--
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
Killaine...
Wonder what?
That's right.
I'm still on course to Victoria. Nobody saw you get on board, nobody seen you since.
Do you think I was faking?
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?
Points very straight to her.
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
To do what?
Sometimes.
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
For two hundred?
Got the information on you?
Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
You're not English.
Round of golf Saturday?
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
I don't.
I never notice the view after the first week.
A couple of hours.
Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
I don't think you locked your door.
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust nasty. You lied about the gun.
He saw my face too.
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl...
I'll know when I find it.
Should be over there.
Such as?
Not if it clears the air.
Sure.  You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell.  If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
She might.
I'll take your word.
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
Not too far, I hope.
What are my orders, sir?
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
You ought to know why.
Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
He was delightful.
Yes.
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
Very good.
I see.
Of course.
...break away completely from--
Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway.
How nice.
Very thoughtful.
I think she liked me.
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
What did he want?
That'll be fun
One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
Name so Susie Barrington.  Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist...
You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man?
Will it be fun?
Why not sit down and wait?
Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.
That's good.
U-huh.
She said that?
We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
You gotta earn trust.
After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
But you're not alone.
I say when it's over!
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
Sir?
Not so far.
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
The shit they pull, huh?
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
They took a left at the next light!
Shrimp and fries.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
What do you mean?
Like the old days, Dillon.
You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
We're not going.
Right behind you.
I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment...
I think it's Hawkins.
He knows our defenses.
Philip!  We'll need shoes!
He's not really my uncle.
Twenty-five percent.
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
Yes.
How?
I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
The price just went up to ten.
If you can figure it out, be my guest.
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
You mean they don't have hookers.
Diet coke.
Do you plan everything?
Why?
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
"Occupational hazard".
... dollars?
What are assets?
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
All right, two thousand.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
Any good?
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
I think it's exciting.
Shall we mingle?
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
Huh?
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
What do you mean?
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
Yes...
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
He's not gonna want us.
Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
Where do you fit?
Wow, are you in deep shit.  You know he'll break your heart.
Do I!?  Momma!
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
Kit give me nothin'.
You're a guest here?
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
What if they serve soup?
Miss Vivian.
Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.
'Scume me.
It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me.
They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?
I will never doubt again.
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
Gently.
It never happened.
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
And a good thing too.
Who's Guilder?
You never said anything about killing anyone.
I thought I was going faster.
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
Everybody ... MOVE!!
The body?
Over the Albino, I think.
Where did you get that?
-- murdered by pirates is good --
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
Sire.
It won't be easy, Sire.
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
I swear it will be done.
Yes.
I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
Not yet.
Stop saying that!
-- offer me everything I ask for --
He's already dead.
Hah?
Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.
Are you a rotten liar.
Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated
That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
Nothing comes to mind.
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
You are ready, then?
Then why are you smiling?
I ought to be after twenty years.
I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
I'm not listening.
It would take a miracle. Bye!
"Honeymoon,
I'll wait in the hall ...
I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady. 
Do the books!  Do the books!
Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
It's nothing ... nothing.
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
Right.
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
Only if we ask him.
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
To failure!
Liebkind, no!
He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 
Yes.  We would!
I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
Hey, Blum, have a cigar.
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work.
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
Heil you know who!
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Vat?
OH.  "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is not place to talk.  Come! 
Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
Oh, sing.  Sing!
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
What?
Of which morning?
No one met her?
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
If she paid you well?
Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
All right.
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
I don't need pills... just sleep.
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
I want to know if my sister is here.
Huh?
Maybe we can handle it together. 
She'll need both of us.
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
Who's he?
Does that mean we can't...
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
All right! Then call! At least, call!
Bates never denied Mary was here.
Why not?
Sam!
Sam. This is the last time.
Can you?
Don't miss your plane.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
You'd know, of course.
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
I mean... ill.  She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain. Oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... Mother met a man. He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked her into anything... and when.  Well... It was just too much for her when he died, too... And the way he died... Oh, it's nothing to talk about when you're eating.  Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
Norman.
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
Maybe you saw Mary!
I suppose you want a cabin.
Haven't any.
Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
I didn't think so.
Shut up!
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
Did she talk?
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
You--a friend to me?
Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
Why didn't you notify the police?
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
He isn't here.
The wound is bleeding!
I'm losing my blood!
A voice ...
No?
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
I don't agree with you.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
Delighted, I'm sure. 
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
Get out of here.
So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid.
What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
You taking any medication?
Day or night?
Where is she?
Nobody.
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
Am I hurting you?
Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
I don't want to know...
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
Daddy, what's the matter?
I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
Yeah.
Okay.
At least.
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
That's all I want to know.  Lets get out of here before I get the epizootics myself. Thank you, Doctor, for your discourse, it was fascinating, no doubt.
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
Oh. Did you say something?
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
You're not having lunch?
Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
Darlin', Rose has got to go!
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
Honey, that's no way to talk to the Doctor, he's merely doing his job, dear.
Over... my... dead... body!
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
Who?
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Got yourself up?
There are more on the other side.
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
Yes, sir.
What?
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
Yeah, I remember it.
I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?
What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
Illusions, Madam?
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
You can stop it right now.
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
Yes, Ma'am.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
Yes, ma'am.
I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with.  So, how's he gonna feel...  ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?
Okay, man, okay.  I'm with you.  I... I heard how the shit's arriving...  It's coming in a Lincoln.
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.
Fair enough.
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.
Alright!  Alright... put me down...
Lay off once, would you?
I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
Clench your teeth.
I don't know.  I could quit now if I wanted, I just don't want to.
They shot us all, kid.
Same day as before.  I think.
You don't smoke.
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
Wha... ?
Bullshit.
It's go time, Billy-B.
Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
There'll be other chances.
You can't be serious.
Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
Well, sir...
Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams.
It's our job.
You know... you could say thank you.
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
Absolutely.
I kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming.
Is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?
All for one...
Out here.  On your knees.
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
Your wish is my command.
Seatbelts fastened, please.
Well, that's what I heard, and that's what I choose to believe.
It's one of a kind.
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
I can't kill my own father.
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
His lightsaber.
We got separated.
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
All right, hang on.
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
Come on! Come on!
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
Your father?
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
But, why must you confront him?
I know, father.
There is no conflict.
Never-r-r!
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
Disintegrated?
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
On my mother's grave.
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
Rocky!
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
It's alright Janet.
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
Yes.
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Goodbye
Free to try and find a game
No no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
You're too kind.
Oh.
...I suppose.
...I suppose.
I don't think you're a bum.
Do you have a phone?
It's fine.
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
I should leave.
They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
...What's to say? I dunno what he wants from me --
I gotta go out for a while.
Apollo?
What're we going to do?
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
Why?
Paul.
Christ.
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
Get that doctor.
You're hurtin', man!
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
Fouls.
Move your shoulders down.
Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face!
Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'
I agree.
Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
Bob.
That's it, I'm broke.
Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for it...
Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
...Thanks.
Sparrin'?
I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
...Yeah.
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
I said, how ya feelin'?
...Tomato?
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
Spider Rice.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
...No.
Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
How do you mean?
Ya got heart.
Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.
Yo, Benny.
Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin down!! Use the legs and drive through 'im. Attack -- Attack -- Attack!
See what?
Would you keep goin'?
Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
Ain't had time to check 'em.
Bullmastiff.
We're not responsible for animals left over thirty days -- We board it ain't a animal shelter, Y'know... Adrian, I want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs, they're a mess. 
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
What?
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
Yeah, sure -- She's very excited.
Keep this job, ya eat better.
What?
Sure I like her.
Whatta these guys want?
Apollo's a great fighter.
Maybe --
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
So where is it then?
Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
Sounds like singin'.
I'll bet.
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
So you're Cloverleaf?
They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
That's right, me.
That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
Why didn't you tell me?
He's right here in the...
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
I don't work in Toontown.
Take it easy.
Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
We can't do anything till it's dark.
Forget it.
Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
From this box here...
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
By my head here come the Capulets.
But new struck cuz.
Of love?
No, cuz, I rather weep.
Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
Ahhh!
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
If my heart's dear love--
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Well, what was yours?
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Right.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
What wouldst thou have with me?
Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
And I don't believe you...
So where do you go from here?
That's why you were riding with him.
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
Is that right?
I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
There's a problem...
But you hate each other!
I swear...
A post office box.
I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
How did you know?
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
Is that right?
I do.
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.
Gregor's cell phone...
You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...
You were smoking?
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
Do what?
Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
Finish it!
It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
Seamus Reilly.
Why didn't you kill him?
How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
You slept with the fucker!!
I'm alright.  And you?
A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
I get the picture.
I hear you.
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
What makes you so sure?
What's that?
He saw everything!
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
What are you thinking?
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
Why don't you get to the point.
What's your offer, Jesse?
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
Nothing happened?
Booth.  Don't.  It's nothing. It's not worth it.  Remember what happened the last time?
There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
How the hell did he find it?
I know.
I love you Sally.
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
I don't know.  My friends...
How about you give us what you have and leave.
We appreciate that.
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Lingerie...
Well I just uh, you know...
Anything...specific?
We are having a sale on some items over here --
Sure.
Sort of.
Well I'm here now.
Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
What?
You're never getting that much.
Well, same ol' same ol'.
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
There was more than that.
We're going to find out.
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
No, sir.
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
I don't think so...
That's right.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
No.
No.
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
This won't take long.
Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
She said I could pick any girl I want.
Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
Don't look at my ass!
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
Ask me if I give a shit.
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
You said --
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
What did you say?
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
What?
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
What?!?!
Yes.
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
I need your help.
Did you tell Sterling?
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
This is still Hong Kong.
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
This is pathetic.
Tell me about it.
No.
A little.
Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
What?
I was being polite.
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
What plate?
Did you make the plate?!
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
Stool pigeon.
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
Yes, I think so.
Going into the restaurant.
This concrete?  This is still America.
I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
Oh yes.
What?
Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
What's wrong with that?
They put you in charge?
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
It's called a dress.
That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
It's okay. For restaurants.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
Nobody touches me.
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
I'm waitin' here for a name.
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
I still have work to do here.
Ike just came by to check out the team.
I'm just bragging about how great you are.  I'm the luckiest man alive.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
He's here!... He's here!
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
I don't know.
Then come for dinner.
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
Are you a reporter?
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
We'll see.
He is not!
How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
You don't know.
Of course.
Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
Can you fix it?
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
You humiliated me!
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
A little longer for me.
I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Lighten up, what?
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
Thank you, Dad.
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
That's good.
What am I going to do with a microwave?
It sounds nice.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
Walter, I'd love to --
Does it have wheat in it?
And then I'll see you in New York --
No.
You couldn't.
Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
About what?
What was what?
Not.
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
I always wondered about that too.
Turn on your radio!
Becky?
M.F.E.O.?
It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --
I know. 
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
Howard.
Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
Sure you do --
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
Seventy... eight.
What is it?
You think so?
I don't know.  Do I?
It's never happening again. Right?
My feelings exactly.
P.  Dad?
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
What?
Whose show was this on?
I know.
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
Is that what she used to sing?
I don't know.
I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
Okay.
It's a short word.
Was Mom an adjustment?
Are you going with her?
Did not.
Goddammit, I am sick of this --
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
Thanks, but... we've got plans.
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
Hi.
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
You want 'em all arrested?
Yeah.
An American.
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
Later. When I finish the ironing.
They are singing for me.
Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
I'm a fool.
Antonio paid for it.
I did forget. Luís told me.
It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
I've had them since the day they were born.
You weren't waiting for me.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that? His grandfather?"
You mean Delaware?
You've got to help around the house!
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
Did you see his hair color?
Now that's down-right insulting.
I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
This man sounds like a real catch.
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
Don't worry. He's out of town.
I try.
This has nothing to do with him.
You can still work.
You always been this stubborn?
I can't tell you.
I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
Danny, it's not what you think.
It's Tom.
I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
Guess it's our turn.
Twelve
You on a roll?
A quarter of a million, Jimmy.
Not tonight.
No. I'm good.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Yes, Jimmy.
You aren't coming with me.
You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?
I don't trust anybody.
That was my idea.
What does that mean?
Understand what?
No, I'm good.
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Hey, I was just trying to ...
Big Bill.
Big Bill
I'll keep that in mind.
Just some buddies.
Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  Now take the money.
When?
Question is, what are you doing here?
Cut the shit, Flynne.
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
We got the 411 on your good old boy.
Jesus.
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
To who?
Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
I still don't know what you're talking about.
And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
They have. But they never found a lab.
Funny, I don't feel lucky.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
What do you mean?
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
Where are your men now?
Thank you, sir.
In West Fork?
No kidding.
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
Like hell, you did.
What deal?
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Say what, Cap'n?
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
A half-track, anything.
I don't expect to live that long.
Did he see any sign of them?
Goddamn it, sir...
I changed my mind.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
PUSH!
Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
Nope.
Is it getting worse?
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Let's just find someplace.
Vecchio.
That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
Just what I want to do.
I'll do my best.
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
There's always a bright side.
Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
You have orders, too.
I don't like that one.
HERE THEY COME!
More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.
Yeah?
And Sarge?
As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
Because he's guilty.
Excellent.
Hey, sis.
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
Yeah.
Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
What's a scam?
I'm gonna call her.
Lloyd.
C'mon Lloyd.
Okay, I got it.
Hang in there, man.
Read it.
If she wants me, she can come to me.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
I'm sorry.  It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
I can accept that.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
Why?  It's fine.  It's nice.
Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
Look at those eyes.
Thank you very much.
Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Pardon me?
You will?  Excellent, alright, this is great.  You will, really?
Goodbye.
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
No.
Yeah.
That's cool then.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
Job?  Being a great date.
Yeah?
I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?
I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
Yeah.
You're shaking.
You're cold.
Then why are you shaking?
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
No I didn't.
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Hello Lloyd.
Yeah.  Honey?
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
So what's up?
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
I don't know.
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
Klaus Tauber.
My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
A charade?  How could it be a charade?
I'm sorry to hear that.
In Breslau.
They're not gone, they're here.
True.
He's important to my business.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
That's great, thanks.
Yeah.
I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
I need a drink.
Wine?
Pistols?
Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
So I'll talk to him about it.
Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
Thank you.
There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
More.
They arrived, can you believe it?
No?
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
That doesn't work, sir.
The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
thought he was doing AA.
I won't.
What is it?
Stop it...
That's smart.
Where is everybody?
I had to change. Did anyone call?
I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
You could start with an apology.
Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes.
Why don't you ask them?
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
The forbidden subject.
No. This is a set up.
But nobody wants to see that. It’ll never go. They’ll rewrite you. You don’t want that.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.
I find his work overwrought.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
You’d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It’s a whole world, Sid. You’re really popular amongst the demented.
We’re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
Tuition’s expensive.
I see you read the book.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
Meaning?
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
Can we turn the light on?
..and as lonely as I am...
Don't worry...
Whatever.
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
My morn was a Delta.
Where is your attacker?
Is Sid in therapy?
What?
Yeah, right.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
Her old boyfriend?
Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
Don't panic.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
I don't know.
Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
It may be Maureen Reynolds --
Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
Catch him, or kill him.
Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
And?
Someone stole Sid's file?
Who is it?
Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
But you know who she was.
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
Good twist.
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
Let's get out of here!
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
Who is this?
Yes.
How do I know their voices are --
I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
I'll call you, when you're on your way.
Are you sure?
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
No one's saying you did.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
Yes, sir.
Now that it's out of your system.
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
You lost your mom...
I called my dad.
Are you alone in the house?
I don't know.
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
So, you gotta boyfriend?
What do you think I said?
To talk.
You getting scared?
More of a game, really.
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
That all depends on you.
No...
Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.
I can't think.
NOOOO....
Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
No it's not. It was Jason.
No, not yet.
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
Sidney's father?
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
Not yet.
How is she?
What about the cellular phone bill?
Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
You think he could still be in town?
As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
Forget it.
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
Why would she lie about it?
What's your favorite scary movie?
And why is that?
If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Don't shoot. It's me.
Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
He came to make up.
Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
What happened?
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Whatever. Just hurry.
Just like old times, ain't it?
I don't know...
Come on, let's rock.
Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
Thank you.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
You're wound too tight, Mills.  Let it go.
Announcing what?
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
Greed.  It was written in blood.
I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
I'll see you.
Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
David... please...
NO!
You'll see.
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
Delusions of grandeur.
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
Sit back.
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
Please be quiet for a while, would you?
What?
Is there any blood in it?
Good.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
Forced what?
Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
Okay.  But, what?
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
It was my first one of these.  We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in.  I was still considered a rookie.
I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
We had him.
I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
That part of me is dead.
One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
When do we get to question him?
You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement.  He wouldn't just stop.
Kiss me on the lips.
What?
It surprises me.  It really does.
I don't know.
It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...
That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
It was, I tell you!
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
You fit a lot of descriptions.
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!
Just keep goin'...
How far's the river from here, Mose?
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
These are my people...  Unnt-meah! Go! Go! <U>Please</U>!
Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
You got it with you?
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
Easy!  It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
Because she's my...my...
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
Think it might be...?
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
Nine...  Ten!
What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
Over there!
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
Ain't worth the mendin'...
Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
Only if I'm dead!
We got two around that age...
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!
You?
My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
Making our very own solstice fire.
We just have to make a new beginning.
And two months later, we got married.  And all because of one sentence:  "With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
In the village.  Look what I found.
Hi, darling.
Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
What are you talking about-
Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
Really?
Sir Robert De Lesseps.
You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
Ned is wrong for it.
And yet you tell me you lie with women?
Nothing comes.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
Yes, I saw it.
Partners!
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
I don't know. It's a mystery.
Very well.
The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
it will be all right, madam.
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
To my weekly confession.
Tomorrow
The one who came with your letter?
God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
How will it?
Do you think?
The daughter of his enemy.
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
Be still.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
Oh, but they can!
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
"Ay me."
Is she obedient?
It is strange to me, too.
Oh
Well perhaps better than my first. 
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
I will do my duty, my lord.
Do you understand me?
He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
It is only ours you can know.
Does she say so?
Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
Will you shut up and play.
I haven't lost yet.
Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
Think about it.
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
Can we talk about something?
Just stop worrying.
You think so?
There was a break-in.
Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
We just wanted to speak to you.
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
I beg your pardon?
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
I don't know anything about it.
This is just an informal discussion.
What does it look like?
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
I see.
Oh, yes, it's great.
I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
Just serve.
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
No, Alex, we don't really love you.
I'm just looking.
Don't look?
Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
OK.
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
No, I don't.
That's not him.
He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
He can't stay up there.
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
Forget it.
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
I'll wait there.
We were just sorting things out.
Oh, shut up, Alex.
That's what I thought he said.
I see.
Burglary?
No, three. Who said there were four?
OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
Did you ever kill a man?
I'm sorry.
No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
What?
No one. I promise.
No one.
Not any real sneering as such, no.
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
You must be Juliet.
I'd be delighted.
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
It's a breeze.
A certain weakness.
And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
Maybe... why do you ask?
That you were just indulging me.
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
Gee, that's very serious...
-- What?
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
What kind of treatment?
You're looking great, baby.
Why don't you see Lester?
Yes.
I don't know. Just a minute...
Hello, George.
Uh-uh.
Let it ring.
No.
No.
Hungry?
No thanks.
... yeah.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
Why?
Don't make conversation with me.
I never get my hair done.
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
I am not!
Right.
They are?
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Oh fuck, Norman!
-- Yeah... your car down here?
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
I'd cut it...
Yeah, I think so...
Great.
Yeah... I mean great.
Yeah... wow.
Do you? You still see him?
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
I won't screw you up.
What?
Hey, I don't tell.
You did, didn't you?
-- we can't now.
You were great.
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
Mmmm --
-- yes, you --
Not me, pal.
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
I don't know if you don't know --
-- please, please forgive me...
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
-- yeah, this is --
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
What're you talking about?
Well, it's a big canyon.  Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.
What?
Who?
You said somebody... who?
No shit?
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
What?
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
I am?
Yeah, baby.
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
Egypt!
I want your feelings about it.
Where's your car?
A business meeting, I told you that.
Look at the way I live.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Let go of me.
Where did this come from?
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
Did you?
Did you?
No?
But Mr. Norman said --
Thank you.
Yes it is.
In a way. But...
After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
You're right.
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
When?
I know what you mean.
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
I don't know what to...
Isn't that bad for it?
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
Well... who are those guys?
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
Didn't they tell you?
Okay, thanks.
I know.
What about her?
Okay.
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
Is that right?
George is going to open a shop.
Aren't you going to have one?
Why not?
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Oh yeah?
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
I know, I'm sorry.
Nothing.
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Well, you know what I mean.
I'm exaggerating.
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
Well, there was this one time --
Didn't you have any panties on?
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
Is he an enemy?
Well... sure...
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
Two weeks from tomorrow.
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
Jill.
No... how long did you say?
-- we're going to be here all night.
Where to, Les?
Yes?
Yes, Dad.
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
Okay...oh!
Yeah.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Oh!
Yes.
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
Sure.
No problem, Mr. Ullman.  I was just getting to the ice cream.
Nice to meet you.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
What line of work are you in now?
Women!  Can't live with 'em.  Can't live without 'em!
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
What time is it?
Hmm, nice.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Why?
I'm not going to hurt you.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stop swinging the bat.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Give me the bat.
Give me the bat.
Yes?
Oh, well - come on in Jack.
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
Oh fine.  Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
Oh...
Hi.
Eight thirty.
Blue. This blue.
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
What?
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
I don't get you.
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
There! You see!
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
But Uncle Al! You said-
See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
Oh?
Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
What about crack?  You a user?
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
Yes, Mary?
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
Yes?
Joey -- do it.
Yes, Betty?
I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes?
Just about.  Show me again.
I know.  It's ancient.
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
Am I?
Because we're
That man -- who is he?
This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
Pay attention...
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
Um, I don't really know this one...
You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.
Wet behind the ears.
Tell me about it.
That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
Five a.m.?
Excuse me?
Are you sure?
Honey.
Keep moving!
HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
We're nuns!
They're from my old convent.
Bless you.
What did He say?
Very well.
You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
What? 
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
Like to who?
A what?
My what?
From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 
Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
Come, Sister.
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?
No.  No.
What do you mean?
You have a phone call.
I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
Oh?
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
Then-you run.
Maybe Hawaii.
Okay -- no limo.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.
You're supposed to be hiding out!
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
How?
What?
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
Really.
They open a window.
Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
We didn't tell you what?
It didn't work, Vince.
Willy -- hit the lights.
Neither did you!
For like, twelve zillion eternities?
Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
We can't leave it up to the Feds!
Really...
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
But how do we get there?
She said they were from her old convent.
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
Excuse me?
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
Not for lack of trying.
More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
The militia?
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
How could he?
Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
Father said witches live there.
No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
We should go.
Man or woman?
To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
What does it mean?
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
Are you so superstitious?
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
Yes, he does.  May I try?
If you want.  But...
I insist that you have it.
They have done nothing of the sort.
There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
Come with me.
It was you there?
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
I do not know.  Away.
No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
No.  She has gone out.
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
What... ?
I didn't see none.
Yes.  Here...
You are from the Hollow?
Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
Doctor, he is awake.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
I like them french-fried potaters.
I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
Okay, stop back by. Don't worry about your boy here, he's doin' good.
How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon.
I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
Don't say nothin' about that boy.
Please Doyle, don't.
Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
I hate you!
I thought I told you to keep out!
A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.
You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then.  It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause I ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm afraid for you to stay here. You're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. Not really, I'm just jokin' with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all the friends he can get. Frank's a real weak little kid. His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.
What numbers do you punch?
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
I did live there in the state hospital.
Yeah.
You told me to come by.
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
Why did he do that, reckon.
Yeah, I did.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
I like the way you talk.
I don't reckon I know.
I heared it cryin' a little through that box.
Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
Is that right?
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
You don't want to give away all your books.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
You know I would. Whatever you want.
Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
Did Karl go to bed?
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.
I reckon.
I ain't got no boy.
You better go get 'em.
I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
I reckon I can just walk around till the mornin'. Or set and read me a book somewhere.
Tolerable, I reckon.
I'll be dog.
Ma'am?
I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
Signs?
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
American literature. What else?
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
I'd love to.
Huh?
What's the difference?
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
Yeah, I did.
Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.
If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?
We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
What is this, some kind of joke?
What difference does it make?
And these?
And these?
Thanks for the tip.
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
Those are pretty hostile words.
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
Jesus.
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
Say hi to Paul.
I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!
Yeah? And why is that?
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
Is your father an artist?
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
I don't have much time. 
Why don't you go to the police?
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
What time did you get to bed last night?
No way.
His only copy?
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
Yes, please.
Oh, yeh?
Didn't say I was buyin' did I? What you want down?  Just bein' curious, is all.
A thousand.
It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
Well, what if?
Why not?
It seems human.  To me.
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
It'll be over soon.  I can get you money.
I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
Oh, in a heartbeat.
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
He said, 'Could it be somebody hit him?'  And I said, 'You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here?'
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
Objection!
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
He didn't want to lose any more.
But even <u>after</u> you had an attorney.  You still claimed to know <u>nothing</u>.  Claimed <u>not</u> to have seen Carl. Am I correct?
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.
Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
No, you don't.
You're wondering why I held it.
Well.  It shows the prosecutor was wrong.  It was <u>Carl's</u> boat that was dead in the water.  Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
I think you like learning.
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
No.
I don't think so.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
Possible.  But not darn likely.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.
Obviously.
The same.
I can't speak for him.
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
Yes.  And that one, too.
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
All right, girls - from the top again.
Thank you ever so.
It's entirely mutual.
Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk.  They went to a conservatory.
Manhattans?  This time of night?
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
Knock it off, will you?
Not yet.  But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over.  Type O.
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.
And I'm Daphne.
Now you tore the other one.
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
You - you -
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
Oh, no.  I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.
I'm engaged.
Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
Shut up and keep packing.
But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight.
I may throw up.
Yeah - lets shove off.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
I'm Sugar Cane.
I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
If there's anything I can do for you -
Stay as long as you'd like.
Interesting.
No, no.
Half-full.
We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.
I'm just going to get some ice.
She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
Come on, Daphne.
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
Well, I'll come back later.
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
Yes.  For a whole year.
Me too.  Bye now.
You don't say.
I'm not surprised.
No, thank you.  I'll walk.
I'll throw up!
Sorry.
Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
We won't breathe a word.
My car?  Why, you -
We'll take it!
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
No - funerals.
Where did he conduct?
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
You are?
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
Saxophone player?
Not at all.
Well, I'm not.
Up, up, up.
You're society girls?
Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
What theory?
Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
It's been delightful meeting you both.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up?
Oh - a member of the herring family.
You're flattering me.
It's more like a mental block.  When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.
What happened?
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Oh, no!
How can you think about food at a time like this?
Thanks just the same.
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
All right - if you insist.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
It's like smoking without inhaling.
I'm not quite sure.  Try it again.
I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
Sorry, sir.  That's reserved for members of the immediate family.
I never join nothin'.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?
Spats Colombo.
If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
Why wouldn't I?
Well, we all got to go sometime.
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
Are you sure you’re okay?
It’s not me. I swear. It’s her. She’s magic.
What for?
Still--
Or Kat....
Whatever you do, don’t mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
Why, with you.
Oh, don’t be that way.
I had to say something to get you here.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
What?
Doesn’t look like nothing.
Oh, hello.
No, tell me.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
You have feet?
I think that’s disgusting.
If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
Oh, no.
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
First of all, it’s never out of the blue. And second of all--
I guess so.
Okay.
Show me.
Oh, cut the crap!
Sure, but it’s never easy. They say they’re okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, they’re not.
Desperation?
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now you’ll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
I wasn’t saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.
Therapist.
Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
Just drunk enough.
I haven’t thought about that in years.
What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nation’s most precious resource: your daughter.
Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
Where is Africa, Miss Johnson?
That's where we come from first?
He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
You could? How?
Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...
Yes mam...
Nothin'...
Yes, Miss Johnson...
Yes mam...
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
NO! N-O, NO!
I did look, Charlie, but I--
You would do that, wouldn't you?
Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
He'll show up one day.
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
What's that, son?
Nathan Lee Morgan...
Sunday...
Yes, David...
David!
That's right!
No mam -- I looked all over.
Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
Good night...
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
I brought these walnuts to trade.
I wanta get some things.
Tired.
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
Will they give him a trial?
You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
Behold my glory.
Dude, she's eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something.
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
How would you like to go to the principal's office?
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
But what are we going to do against this entire army?
Okay.
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
Yeah,  <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!!</b>
It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
Yeah!  And what rim job expert went and outlawed Cheesy Poofs!?
Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.
You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
Norwegian Ass Raper.
HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases!
This is it! The time for action is NOW!!  <b>Something must be done! This is like a spreading rash! They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of smut and sex and poo! I believe the good fight has begun! Something must be done!</b>
It's that v-chip thing that's inside you, Eric!  The polarity must have been reversed by the electric chair!
It's... It's not good children.
Doky maping she deeder!!!
Baba mama!
Fallen one... We have such sights to show you!
MPH RM!!!
Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
Aw, ma!!
Dude, what the hell is going on?
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
Uhh... Bacon.
Yeah, I guess.
Oh... Alright, back you go.
Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
You bastards!!
What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
Hey, come here, guy.
I am.
I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
You don't care.
<b>Hey, guy, relax, put out! You gotta relax, shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-</b>
No! It can't be!
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
Yup.
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
Hi Stan.
What's the matter, Wendy?
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
And ze rope?
Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
Very professional of you.
Well it's a good thing that I did.
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.
Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
Will you transmit the distress signal?
Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
That's right.
You're right.
Yeah?
Sure.
It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.
What?  What are you talking about?
And so far.
Marry you?
He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
The engines!
Mac.  What's shaking?
Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
That's affirmative.
He's my dad.
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
Are you guys bruddas?
It was a clearance.
No kiddin'.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
Wait! That's an aria!
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.
brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch.  And now we got a beautiful thing.
Theo.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
She's my mom.
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
I never saw you.
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
Clam it!
Who's there?
You shouldn't touch her.
SHEILA!
Someone wants to play with me?
Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.
I like the sport the way it is.
How Mr. Kastle?
See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
Yippy!
Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
Everything has it's drawbacks.
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
It's a vicious cycle.
What's plan C?
Really? I kinda like it.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
You're here.
Too late for what, Sheila?
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
It?
I told him you were my boyfriend.
Did you - kill him?
I feel sick.
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
Open it, Captain!
I said back away.
How about I just press the button?
How long will that be?
Two and a half days?
Yeah.  I heard you.
Do you see it?
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
A thousand feet.
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
What's wrong with oxygen?
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
What do you mean, he's missing?
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
When was this?
But sir, I think it's imperative.  I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related.
You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
Working on it now, sir.
Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
Well, where the fuck is he?
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
Then how can it be chipped?
It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
She's not gonna know.
Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
Radiation shield, you think?
What do you make of this?
What?  No, I know they're civilians...
To what?
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
Underwater?
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
What -- are you threatening me?
Get this thing off me.
What about you?  What happened to you?
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
Beth.
You went through Edmunds' things?
You bastard.
Why should I go?
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
The refridgerator.
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
Sintag.
Antihistamine.  For bites.
How do you spell it?
It's a soporific.
What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.
Beth --
Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
For what?
Where are you?
I'm feeling better.
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
C'mon -- what?
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
It's either this... or I kill you.
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
C'mon --
Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's go home.
By the bunks.
For whoever's in that thing.
Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
I never said that.
Like what?  I'm not --
We can refuse to talk.
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
What?
Wait a second, I --
Look, would you --
Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
What are they?
Her suit's gone.
I thought she was with you.
Stop what?  What are you -- ?
You got her?
No idea.
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
That's right.
But it's impossible.
Look closely.  That isn't writing. Those are grooves.
"We are friends".
Thank you.
It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
No, they didn't say --
Huh?
You mean you don't know?
Geologists?  At a plane crash?
You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.
Why's that?
You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.
You mean we should go after her!...
Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
Yes, sir.
I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
I'll make a report later.
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
Move out of the way!
I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.
Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
YAAAAAAAA !
I didn't see him !
He was our teacher... He was great.
Not enough, I guess.
We're the old men, Ace.
You heard the Lieutenant ! On the bounce, troopers !
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
What's the hurry ?
Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
Only when I give you an order.
Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
Funny...
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
Excuse me...!
A funeral.
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
I have good reflexes.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
You two have so much in common.
Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
I like it. It's kinda...you.
How are you, Carl ?
Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.
Yes, ma'am.
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
I'm gonna need a squad leader.
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
All bands.
A year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
Oh, is that how it is ?
Keep trying, Sergeant.
Sir, yes, sir !
Courage, I guess.
Aw, don't get mushy.
Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
Yeah, that's right.
Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.
Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
Yes, sir !
To join with him.
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
The information will not be disclosed.
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
Yes, sir, I'll do that.
The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
Impact in fifteen seconds...
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
Thrusters ahead, one third.
Thrusters at station keeping...
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
There is no alternative.
That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
I'm goin off-shift.  Come on...I'll walk you home.
He'll eat potroast and like it.
Who?
Why did you quit?
It's in your play.
Yes.
It's about life.
Yes...
Of course.
Everyday things...yes.
Mmm.
You'd know better'n me.
Well, first, you got to change the title...
Yes.
You got a paperclip?
You have to sign for it.
The other side.
Then I'll come back, then.
So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.
She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
It does?
Yes...
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
Water or mineral deposits.
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
That's so beautiful...
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
Hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.
Hi.
Whatever it is.  GO <u>do</u> it.  How you doing on the permit?
And I need a drink.
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
On the coast?  Of <u>course</u> he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the <u>Hague</u>...
This horse is booked.
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
But, that's the way of the world, huh? Everybody's gotta eat.  Way of the world.
Bourbon and Milk.

I swear that that woman in my room...
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
We've got three days to...
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a <u>schoolnight</u>, something...
Joe, the writer?
You mind...?
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
Mr. Barrenger.
Well.  What seems to be the...?
There's other things to be learned.
I think he's moved...
Then what is the...?
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
Yes, yes, but...
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
Yes.
The minute I read that script I said...
Well.
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could <u>possibly</u> make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
Yes.
You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
Sure.
You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
Did you, where are we going tonight...?
I grew up on your mov...
I don't drink.
I hurt my finger.
The girl was in the car.
Her tits!  Her tits!  How, that she signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the Actors Studio? The way she played <u>Medea</u>?...Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first <u>wife</u>...
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
The breasts symbolize motherhood...
...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...
Find the money.
No no no no no no no no no find me the money...
"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
And we're glad to have you here...
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
Mmm...
It takes all kinds.
Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
Givvem a cigarette...
I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
I killed her!
Mommy's marrying Rache!
She's <u>dying</u> and <u>Rache</u> is your mother now!
Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
Sex.  Of course.
Why does Rachel scream?
What are you gonna talk about?
I'll be there for you.
Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
This is a joke, right?
I'm not.
Of course not.  Does he look lost to you?  BENNNNN!!!
Don't touch me!  I'm <u>allergic</u> to you!
This is my daddy's house --
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
That's so weak.
You think this is funny?
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
Annabelle put down that camera.
There's worse things.
No.
Fine.
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.
That's Rache's song!
Before you.
I helped.
Rache says it's from you.
But you can still see him.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
Every day.  More and more.
Let's take our best shot.
Have you still never told him?
I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
You think I didn't get that?
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
Just not to me.
To make it easier for them or you?
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that.
I live or I die.
A lot smaller.
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
But it's not on the schedule!
Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
Yes?
Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay?
Don't flatter yourself.
Nobody likes a snoop.
You're a cross-dresser.
Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
Thanks, but it's under control.
...go to the park.  In the worst way.
You mean, after I'm dead?
You weren't passing 'em out.
And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.
Neutral ground.  What's up?
Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.
I have their past.
I didn't want to spoil our supper...
Jesus.
Can't handle them myself is what you mean.  Can't.
I trust you of course I do but --
But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
I know that.
Excuse me.  'Things are so confusing for me, Jack.  Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able.  It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules.  When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
I'm gonna get me a drink.
Like what?
He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
Yes, Mikey?
Yes.
My Jesus…
My baby.
Jesus was not bad.
I know!
It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...
The same.
Man, it's just, like, conversation.
One in a million recover.
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Toby Oxman.
Yeah?
No, thanks.
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
So where'd you get in?
Sure…um…yeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
Don't be. Your movie's a hit.
Well get someone down there!
Why? Are we going dancing?
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
What happened?
Used to Filmore, used to.
Because I'll be firing at them.
Rule two:  without alternative, use yourself as a shield.
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
Like where--in your dreams?
Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
What does that mean?
All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.
Yes, of course.
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi.  R...T...T...There's only three combinations of -- T...T...R, or T...R...T...
Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
What?
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
Do you recognize my voice?
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
That's right, sir.
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
I know that, sir.
You're damned right they are.
Perfect.  Thank you, Major.  And now let's drink a toast.
Ask away, Major.
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
I presume the planes are armed?
What the hell is Plan-R?
Knock it off will you, General?  Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.
Roger. One-three-eight.
Maybe it's an exercise.
War?
Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
They're moving apart.
Yeah?
Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.
Ready, Major.
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.
Very interesting.
Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
I've got one.
Primary trigger switch.
First safety.
Seond safety.
Master Kong.
Everything still checks out okay.
Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
Listen, give me a shot quick!
What are you talking about?
You tell me.
Right.  So how could we get any messages?
I don't get you, King.
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
But I get a red light.
Yes.  The radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.
But who would be chosen?
Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
"Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think?
Yeah.
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
Mm-hm.
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
Oh.
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Right now?
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Needs some pizza in his diet.
You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
Ah!
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
Okay.
So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!
You know?
Look.
I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
Come on.
Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went?
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Shit.
Buff is funny. God.
I'm so burnt-out.
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Hey, thanks, man.
No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.
A reel?
I'll be in the car, okay?
He is.
And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.
What about me? I don't have a car.
You cut off your little finger?
It's nice to do a lot of things.
I'm not a nice guy.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Thank you.
Mm-mm.
He's drunk.
Because I'm alienated.
No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to...
No.
What?
Wow. You did that for me?
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
Oh, shit.
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
Just go home, alright?
Just put it down.
Look, why do you care, huh?
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
It's a piece.
Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
Like what?
Yeah.
I would've stopped it.
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
Mm.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
Wait. What, what are you saying?
'Bye, Jeff.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?
No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
What?
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
It's stupid.
Oh, yeah?
It's pretty exciting.
Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.
Yeah.
Oh, no, man. I can't.
I can't believe you're still here.
Yep.
That's because I am.
Oh, my god!
Really? What else does your mother say?
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
About what?
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
Don't do that, man, okay?
It's none of my business?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Come on, Jeff.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
Don't swear it's impolite.
Sorry, Kansas...
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it?  Hee-hee hee...
Y'think?
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
Well, I want to know what happened --
He is the Great One...
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Bullets.
I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...
That's okay, Hannah.  It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies.  Sex - you can learn from movies.  But robberies?  There's no way.
We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
Oh yeah, you caught us...
Definitely old.
Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.
But you're not married.
Uh...maybe?
All of you!
My what?
So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!
I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
Why, you sweet kid.
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...
Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
Was I?  I'm sorry.
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
I don't want it now.
Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.
This is where you live?
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
Why did she call me?
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
Lady.  you've got the wrong man.
It is not.  Get out.
I know your face.  You're Norma Desmond.  You used to be in pictures.  You used to be big.
Uh-huh.
And you'll play Salome?
December twenty-first.
Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
You can stay here.
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
What right do you have to take me for granted?
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
You're a darling.
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
Good.
Why do you say that?
You think I made that up about the gun...
Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
No, they don't.
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
Madame is waiting.
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
I'm not here.
We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
Frankly, no.
No?
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
But where?
Softball.
But which one?
He will be. In about five minutes.
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
It's a warning, that's for sure.
There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
Who didn't?
You love me?
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
Yes. It reminds me of home.
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
No.
Terrific.
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
But why?
Are you asking me for a "date"?
Do you want to come to Argo City?
Hmmm?
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
A passionfruit smoothee.
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
I don't want your help.
Supergirl?
The scoop of the year!
Oh, sure.
How do you know?
You bet your ass.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
I'd love to.
Cigarette?
Throw him out.
I have to talk to you.
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
Criminals.
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
Then come with me.
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
Buddy, are we in trouble.
There's no vodka in it.
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
No, thanks.
Old ties are hard to cut.
Uh-huh.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Sure.
Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
Mmmmm . . .
What's that?
At one o'clock in the morning?
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
Decaffeinated too?
What are you talking about, fella?
God, that's what I keep you for.
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
We've already got some.
What will it get me?
Tell me more...
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
We gonna crash?
Just a second.
That's his sister. Vera Webster.
What about me?
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
Anytime.
We've already met.
Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
Storms! Floods!
Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
Today coffee----
We already have a super-tanker.
Don't bet on it!
It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
So far the hostages are unharmed.
She'll be fine.
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
You're not selfish at all.
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --  Hell, I'll tell him.  Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  Kent,	I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.
Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
Sentimental idiot.
We must combine our strength.
What about here?
No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
I'm not so sure you do.
It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
Something . . . wonderful.
A toupee that flies?
But why the hair?
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
There!
This wasn't in the plan.
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.
High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
Bunkers!
Thank you.
Not you.  You.  Tell me again.
Lois isn't here?
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
North. It's north
Not really, no.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
He may have a gun!
Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
You're not the only one.
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
You?! How about me?
I know...
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
Tea?
I'm wearing it.
Of course I can. I love you.
This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 
He sure as heck does that.
Folks'll ask question.
Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
Enjoyed it?
There are none of them any good anyway.
Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
I came to talk to you.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
What about it?
I...uh...check.
Otis...
Ah, dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him.
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
--  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...
I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
We'll see how fast I can fly.
I'd heard that.  But she's well?
She didn't.
It turns to steaming piss.
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
I will.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
Why are you telling me this?
Why not?
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
Billy, that's too early.
When the game's over, I guess.
It's natural.
I better get back.
You believe that?
Why?
Well I don't.
Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
And what's that?
Did they give him special care?
What's that, Dolores?
Yes.  He does.
I did.
Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
Why would he be frightened?
Hi, Dolores.
The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies.
Summer's over.  It's fall.
We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
It's interesting.
Oh.
What, Mason?
Thank you, Nicole.
People who will help our cause.
Almost three.
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
No.
No.
Any criminal record?
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
Yes.
Yes, I understand.
Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly now.  It seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  I was scared.
Yes.
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
Really?
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
Don't even try to remember.
Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
But Charlene...
Is "he" inside?
Thanks, I see him...
The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
I doubt that it matters any more.
And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
See my mother?
Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
Give me a chance --
You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
No.  I'm going home.
I don't believe it.
Can I come in for a minute?
You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
I don't?
I'll listen one more minute.
When?
You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
But not for anything I did today...
Talk to her yourself...
What about?
Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
At the bar - Sidney...
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
What sort of thing?
He wants me to break a leg?
But what?
Help me with two minutes of silence!
I hate to see you like this --
Take a top coat.
Begging your pardon, I haven't been down the bowery in years!
Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here -
Why not you?
It is a favor, isn't it?
You tell him, I stutter!
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
Like you?
I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
Steve, stop it please...
Why did you call me?
Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
What chip?
You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
Anything it samples by physical contact.
It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
That is one of my mission parameters.
What?
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
No problemo.
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
No problemo.
Remember what I said, you can't...
What?
Yes.  Throw it in.
I have to go away, John.
Gimme that Phillips right there.
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
Alright, it!  We need it!
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
Go!  I'll finish here.
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
Open the goddamn door!
Unknown.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
Why attack Russia?
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
Please continue...
Relax now, Sarah --
Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares.
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday?
Why not show Dr. Furtwängler the evidence. It may refresh his memory?
Yeah.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
No can do.
Yes.
Three months.
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
May I ask a question?
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
I was warned.
I wish to say something.
No!
And what happened to Von der Nul?
You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Helmuth.
How could I forget?
Show you?
Yeah?
The Miracle Kid.
Yes, Dr. Furtwängler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Like this bandleader.
Absolutely not.
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
All.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
Great.
What's it to ya?
That's none of your business.
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.
Kyle.
White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
What?
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
About where you're from.
No.  I'm not.
You're not supposed to.
Why?
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
Shut up.
Projections were far too optimistic.
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
Did you?  Kudos.
I apologized, I offered to help.
A game?
Where are you going?
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
Why... ?
That tall, bright building.  Near there.
Investment banking.  Moving money from place to place.
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
Come here...
Well... the red bra.
Get out of my car!
No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
How?  How could they have gotten anything?
I didn't say anything.
What... what do you mean?
You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
Where'd you get that gun?
Fuck you.
Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
Stop talking to them!
No...
Single?
Boyfriend?
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
They'll be wanting it back.
I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
Really?
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
Yes.
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
I'll call.  I really will.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail.
It was a different floor then...
Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
Ilsa... you're alright?
I'm not sure.
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
Did you worry about him?
Goodnight.  Where was she?
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
You know you can.
What about the house?
You warm my heart.
You could have.
We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.
For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic.  Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, sorry...
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
It was.
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
Why?
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her.
There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
I don't know what you mean.
You're okay.
David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
No, it's getting worse.
I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
I don't know what to think anymore.
Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
Then what good is he?
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
I'm sorry.
I'm a gracious host.
All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
We think?
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
This is un-fucking professional.
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
Let him break - he likes to break.
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
Been to the Boat Show.
I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
Not me, man.
Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
What post office?
Not much -- you?
No, but I know what he means.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
That's not what I heard.
Try calling me again.
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
Now who's being sarcastic?
Not ashamed.
How'd you manage that, then.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
Nah, accommodation address.
Based in London, but with international concerns.
This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
What about your grandmother?
What'd your father do?
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
How do you know?
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
Eh?
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
Ian?
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
Sounds like you need a rest.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
I don't know.
"He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
I doubt it.
Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
You know I don't live with him.
Who's looking for you?
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Yes. Thank you.
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
We've certainly missed you.
Boy.
He didn't say that.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.
I can get it, yeah.
Maybe.
All right, I guess.
What is it, Dave?
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
But it's...
...Huh?
I, uh...
Told what?
Honey?
So?
Congratulations, Gina.
...OK.
Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific.
And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
I'm fine. Thanks.
Huh?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
What the hell are you talking about?
What'd he say?
Crane. Ed Crane.
Yeah--
Hello.
Ah.
Not an owner.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
What doors?
It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
Correct.
The sub-basement?
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
Got my hands full here.
Oh shit.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
Look who's here, Margo.
Yes.  John made quite a study of the whole museum.  He had a copy of my original plans.
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
What is it?
Big as a house.
Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
Another storage room.
But at what a price.
What's that?
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
What kind of hormones?
So what?
A monster?
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
Would you mind showing it to me?
I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
You were behind me?  Running after me?
Where did you see it?
I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
How?
Oh God!  Help!
No, hold back...
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue.  Operators are standing by.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
You're the star.
Oh, yes.
That's right.  Lauren.
So when are you leaving?
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
It's a surprise.
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
I won't be here Sunday.
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
What?!
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
You blaming me for the traffic?
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
--Truman, you're gonna be late!
It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
Fine.  I'll tell her.
Were you there--how do you know?
We don't even know you.
Yup.
What do I do.  I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.
Me?
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
Yes.
They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  Maybe a small roadside memorial.
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
You got some kind of business with him?
No. Don't bother.
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
Do you?
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
You can't.
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
I think they have that covered.
No you didn't.
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
All I told them was the truth.
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
Get dressed, Scully.
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
According to this tag.
There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
All the equipment is brand new.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
-- of what exactly?!
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
I don't know.
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
I need you on this, Scully --
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
I think... something stung me.
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
Where are we?
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
How deep does this go?
About the conspiracy?
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
Lucien Baines?
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
Yes mother.
Why did we stop?
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
I realize that...
I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
What's wrong?
She's bringing Stargher into hers.
I'll get her...
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
Next time, tell me, okay?
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
He was Harry's driver?
The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia.
Well you read this.
Me.
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
He told you, didn't he?
Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
How did you know I would be here?
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
His.
Why are you lying?
Of course.
They're Harry's.
There's nothing in them.
What did you say? I'm sorry...
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
Can I have that woman's passport?
Fellow called Lime.
What are you trying to say?
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
Which side of the road?
She's right. It's none of my business.
Take him to Sacher's.
No, no. Leave them for a while.
Goodness, that's awkward.
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
What about?
Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
Very popular. Are you staying long?
Excuse me, have you got tooth...
I told the police.
And - Anna...
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
At the end of every chapter --
I live in the Russian sector, but you'll find me at the Casanova Club every night. One has to work...
Yes.
Who?
Must be some mistake.
Yes, yes, I remember you.
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Who else?
Yes.
I am not a bad man.
Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
What else?
He didn't want to get involved.
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
A novel, Mr. Martins?
Why no, Mr. Martins.
Never.
Here.
Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
What!
I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
I'm sorry.
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
One night I will get the perfect photograph.
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
That's a movie, you moron.
Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
We'll go to the country sometime, okay?
No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.
Why won't you talk to me?
That's stupid.
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
Even though his dick is so big?
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
You shouldn't.
Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
I'll go look....
Who's Eichmann?!!?
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
How would you kill him?
What about Curtis Zampf?
I agree.
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
Of course they're Jews.
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
Listen to me....
Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as God.
What were you, following me?
If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
The arguments, anyway.
I can't help what I think.
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
A forty-five.
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
That's meat.
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
Steve...
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
I've got to get back to the --
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...
Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.
You could do it.
You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
Here...
I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
I'm not hungry.... Come on, let's drive around.... We don't want to be spotted here.
So what do we do with the device?
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
Four. But no one this important.
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
Do I give a shit?
Funny?
Fund-raising??
What?
Eat shit....
As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem.
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
The documents are forged.
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
Hello!
What was he like, when he was little?
No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!
You know what I'm talking about.
I won't, I swear.
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
What does that mean?
Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.
Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?
What room have you got?
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
Everything about what?
As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
... I'm listening.
The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
What is it?
Thank you, thank you very much!
Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
Well that's very nice of you.
Who?
I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
I don't know... why?
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
I did?
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
I got fired.
I'm still here.
Uh... Ah!  A story?
It's me again.
Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
Johana... New York.
Again?
Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
Way past it.
No.  I'm just depressed.
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
But... how is he going to breathe?
What's your first move?
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
What's up?
Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
Please, call me Mordechai.
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
Yeah, no kidding.
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Oh. Okay.
Keep going.
Oh, she said that, did she? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say?
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
Happy Hanukkah Morty.
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.
A stereo type alarm system?
Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
Why not?
Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
Nice fellow?
I sleep it off.
Where? Where did you find it?
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
Who?
Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
Tomorrow -—
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
Rosita —— I have wondered -—
Hey —— I'm over here.
Good evening.
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
That's right, of course.
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
About Charlie's leopard?
No.
I couldn't rest —- I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter —whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
Why?
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.
Don't be soft.
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
Yeah.
That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
What! You can't be --
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
I know -- Teresa -—
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
Will you please come with me?
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
I’m afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brother’s in trouble.
Disney! How inter...
Oh no. You’ll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
You knew he had nothing to do with your brother’s disappearance, didn’t you?
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
Leon hung himself...
You don’t say.
Think what you like. But don’t presume to understand.
You seem to know what you’re talking about.
What are you doing? You can’t. I...
He... He is dead!  MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!  Call my parents. They’ll tell you. Call them!
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
I don’t know. Everyone’s dead...
A call box? That’s odd. Where exactly?
Can you tell me how you spell...
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.
French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didn’t have any. I used a British passport. My name’s not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
I know where to look.
I wouldn’t mind. Thank you.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
Thank you. But I think I’ll go to bed. It’s been a long day.
We’re both thinking the same thing, right?
That-that won’t do. That’s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that’s the way...
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For god’s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
That’s right. Where’s the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?
She’ll be alright. She’s tough...
What sort have you got?
... Fine. I’ll go for the safe place.
You... Fuck you!
Jee... Fuck... You’re fucking mad!
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
The company. We all work for the company.
Just me...  Martin’s gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, I’ve got to get to...
Can I have the reception desk, please.
How are you, Jane?
No.
It’s not.
Your secretary, huh!
What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
Yes. How did...
May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
Didn’t you say I came recommended?  That’s what I thought. May I know by whom?
You wouldn’t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
Jah...
Shut up and drive!
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who can’t do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
You’re making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guy’s not one of Friedman’s...
We need a double-room and as I understand you’re here alone we’d be much obliged if you’d agree to move to a single room...
I’ll be alone.
Oh. This is... We’d arranged to meet tonight and I’m due to return to Paris tomorrow...
Yes. You wouldn’t know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
Where’s your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
The nineteenth... How come you didn’t know?
He... Apparently the hostility was all hers. Leon didn’t... It hurt him. They used to be close...  Their parents were in their forties when they were born, you see. And mostly away. They grew up in a Scottish mansion with old nannies and servants. He... “Our world was so old and cold, we shone for one another,” Leon used to say. His sister cut him off after she got married. He never understood why but thought it was because she had no children. Was bitter...
I... How long have I been here?
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesn’t appeal to you...
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pré- pubescents.
Où est passé ton salon?
A l’achat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais ça pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. C’est pas vraiment mon truc.  I don’t know any Austrian, Xavier.
If you can, send me a receipt.
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didn’t you know?
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldn’t go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only ‘cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didn’t need your confession...
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn’t easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what’s your business with these Spitzes?
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
How dare you stop me doing God's will!
But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
I promise...
Well...
What... what do you mean?
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
You make it sound so simple...
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
To marry you.
If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
Not yet!
I want to stay with you...
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
Sound the retreat...
Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
I don't know...
And so I... I prefer my banner.
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
And when was that?
To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
We want her burned as a witch!
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
What about you?
I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
Not unless you hear my confession.
Yes...
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
... You look wonderful...
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
Noooo!
If there was, I didn't see it...
Yes.
Go on to the next question.
That's not a lot.
Yes... they were.
For what?
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
Not yet.
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
That'll put fire in my soldiers!
But the bridge has been pulled down!
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
I... submit to Our Lord.
That's now what I meant...
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
Yes... lots of things!
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
In His name??
Really?
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
Do you think this cross will protect you?
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
No...
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
Oh, yes. I remember.
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
What's happened?
What, I'm working, what?
Who told you?
Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
Hungry.
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
Yes, so did the Germans.
Yes, but what good did it do?
So, what's the news?
There are always notices going up.
Toilets?
Not this week.
I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
You're a dirty pig!
Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
Watch your feet!
Watch his hand
It will be very dramatic.
To be deaf?
Like it were a piano?
No sound at all?
That is good, yes.
Baines is packing up?
No, no bible readers.
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
No, no they know another track - to the side of this.
I'd like to make a swap.
The piano.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci.  UNSUBTITLED
Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
Nothing just yet
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
No, not words.
Hello.
Tomorrow.
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
No.
Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
No.  Never saw him before.  He's a dick, though.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
What?
Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet.  I can go halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
Shove off, Duff.
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
Who's got the contract?
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
What do ya want the others to get?
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  You played the Big Con since then.
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
I never played for winos.
Well we got some workin' money anyway.
I thought I'd lost him.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
It was too noisy.
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
Then why you doin' it?
The wire is ten years outa date.
I also gotta win.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
You're more gutless than I thought.
You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
Where's June today?
2:00 A.M.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
He cheats.
Yeh, he knows that.
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway.
All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply all the money and the information.
I am after this race.
Let me talk to him.
I didn't get the bet down in time.
Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
For fifteen years.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
You know how they are... sex...
I'm sorry.
He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.
He's just around the corner.
You've got to get your mind off this.
You're talking like a crazy person,
Nothing.
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
And I'll give then proof!
He's waiting for you.
What do you mean?
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
Macaulay.
Oh, thank heaven.
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
Forgive me.  How are you?
You see how much we have to say.
What would your mother say to that?
If you think it'll be all right.
You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
Only in bad weather.
I'm very interested in that body.
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
What's that to you?
No.
Man to man, I'm not.
Who's your candidate?
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
--was Wynant's.
He did!
Why yes.
No.
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
Want to take a poke at him?
Marian!  Marian! Don't go! I'll behave!  I'll do anything!  Don't go, Marian!
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
Never mind.
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
Good.
Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
What'll I do if something comes up?
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?
Well, don't you?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him?
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
Oh, this is Andy --
Six Martinis.
Santa Claus.
I wonder if they've --  I don't want to hear anything about it.
Yes.
Well, didn't you?
No.  It's a Christmas present.
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
I don't believe he did it.
Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
Smart gal.
Got a nice evening dress?
Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner..... 
I wish you'd tell me.
No, Mr. Charles.
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
No... no.
I know I left them there.
You did.
Baghdad.
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
Wha...
Low on gas.  Got to refill.
You just go when I say go.
We can fight.  That's what we're here for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.
What do you figure it to be?
Then get up and do something about it.
Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.
We're at war.
What if I do?
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
You don't know John Epps very well, do you?
I have to answer him.
There might be something in there.
I did it!  I got the box open.
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
Roger that.
Oh, that's fun.
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
Millionaires, man.
We leave it.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
Just relax.
Epps...
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
What are they doing here?
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
Stay low.
They can't shoot us in here.
I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
What?
We'll find our way.
Forget Wes.
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
Well, we should identify ourselves.
Probably.
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
When did you make the switch?
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
Then I'm a rich man.
Threatened to blow my brains out?
What?
Thought you were going to buy a car.
I don't know.
We'll make up some kind of lie.  They won't find the gold.
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
I thought it would be good to know.
I could.
What!?
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
Oh, God!
I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
Lines up with the map and the photos.
Guess we know what the next stop is.
He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
Now.
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
What?
Promise...please don't THX leaves the room.
I don't want to lose you.
I don't know.
I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
No!...No!...
We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed.  You can work with us.  An organized plan of escape must be devised first.  Could you see anything?  You want to leave.  You're not like them.  You must have left something, or someone.
THX and me.
Where is LUH?
I don't feel well.
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
When?.....How?
Look more closely.
We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?
What kind of answer is that?
You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence:  Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5.  Roommate 3417 LU...H.
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
No?
All right...
Where's LUH?
I did not accept any.  I...  I wanted... to.  But I didn't. You know I didn't.  Don't you?
You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
Officer Reilly, vice.
Go ahead.
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
What do you mean?
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
Where...?
Yep.
Look, it's a longshot...
`Til we get a better lead.
Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things... 
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
Be right back.
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
Me, too.
You got it.
It's from an IRA.
We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.
Taylor's dead.
People are dying.
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
What? Nobody, I-
Shut up!  Who is this?
Take him!
And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
Nothing so far.
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
Shit. We're fucked.
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
What?
Huh?
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
Goddamit, Reilly--
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
I promised her she'd be safe.
And it had diamonds in the back.
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba. 
Constantinople?
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
Good morning.  I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.
Umm.
The type they marry.
I thought so.
Just dull.
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
I've got to see you.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
No, to you--M'sieu <u>Monescu</u>.
What do you mean?
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
No--no.
I would like to.
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
Thank you.
I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.
You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out <u>with</u> the Bank of Constantinople?
Last year? It can't be that long.
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
We'll take the Royal Suite!
And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!
Yes!  Now don't worry!
He recognized you!
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
Yes.
I remember.
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Oh!
M'sieu Laval!
Too much blue in crimson.
Peaches and cream.
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
This used to be my secretary's room.
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
Um-hum ...
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
You would?
I know it.
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Yes, Gaston?
And you expect me to believe that?
Goodbye.
Divine ...
But it could have been glorious.
I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to-- 
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
How much is your salary?
I don't want your money!
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
A hundred and one next month.
Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.
Lewis...
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
Not the better half.
Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
We've struck ice.
Could I speak to you in private?
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
Yes, exactly!
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
Au contraire, mon cher.
I'll be right back.
Right.
I'm so cold.
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
Charmed, I'm sure.
How can you put this on my shoulders?
Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
Yes--and <U>very</U> popular-- 
Montana?
<U>Gladly</U>.
I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
Where's Lother?
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
Decent?  I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
Lose?--I won a little--
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
Shortie, look!
Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
No, sir?
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Are you screwy?
Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
I'll go with you--
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
I wouldn't be surprised--
Hey!--you're tickling me.
I would--but our rehearsal starts right away.  Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
She did?
What's that?
That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
Next month is June.
June? That's my wife's name.
O.K.! Send that!
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
Knots!
Who won?
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
Good-night, folks.
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
Eh?... Oh.
There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
About twelve hundred.
It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
I sincerely hope so--
What's the matter?
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
Telegrams.
Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst.  Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call.  Cover your ears, darling.
Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say!  Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend I Don't think I could bear it.
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Nice voice.
Absolutely nothing.
Beauty, ain't he?
Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!
Oh, Jesus, Johnny...
No...
Excuse me?
But wait, you don't understand-
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
Yeah, you look it.
I was kidding about that.
Say when.
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
Don't touch me, God damn it!  Just Don't touch me!  Come on...
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
Sorry...
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
Wyatt, are you crazy?
You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
I laugh sometimes
Where do you get these questions?
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
Wyatt...
Well, excuse me for askin', Milt, But isn't it kinda dead in here?
Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this.
Mattie, they're here!  Folks this Is Celia Ann but you can call her Mattie.  Or even Mrs.  Earp if you Prefer.
No really, I can stay a while.
All right, well, good night.
You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?
If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.
There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys. What they do's their affair.  I Don't preach and I don't judge.  I Ain't no dog-catcher.
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
I'm the one made a mess.  Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing.
You're on.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Jack...
They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
Sure...
Hit a streak when we left.  Him And Kate.
Better go with 'em, honey.  Here's Where I leave you.
Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...
You are the one, Wyatt.  You sure are.
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
Wyatt...
Yeah, and dangerous.
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
Sir Elliot.
I can feel your pain.
So why did you leave?
What about the gold?
Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
Where can I find him?
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
Is that any way to say hello?
I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
How is old Q?
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
I didn't think so.
Thanks.  Take care -
I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
Let's not make it a habit.
Up.
Trust me.
Are you listening to me?
If not?
I didn't say when I want to die -
I understand.
Good luck on your mission, 007.
Sabotage?
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
No -
What's wrong?
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
One to seven: Deal the face cards.
Who is it?
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
I don't know. He's not in the database -
Since when?
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
I would like to finish reading this. What would I talk about? I haven't read this month's almanac. I don't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes. They pride themselves in making life hard and that's not my cup of tea.
Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
Why in the h...
Like a veil has been lifted?
You were in hell?
Do you think you won?
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
What for?
I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets.  I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.
It is just a regular card.
Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
Babe Brother is a poor boy.
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
It's healing now.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
Why didn't you catch a plane?
Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor.
Well, I would appreciate that.
Well, I don't want to put you out.
You should go back and rest.
Tolerable well.
You must have done something to her.
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."
Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
What's a toby?
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.
Whadda ya think?
You can bring ONE toy...
Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
What?  What is it?
Let's let Molly open one.
Mm-hmmmmm.
Watch yourself!!
Excuse me.
No, you can't.
You can't!
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
Where?
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Where is it?  I don't see the --
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
We're not aiming for the truck!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Everyone, it's Woody!
Sorry there, old Spudhead.
Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
How 'bout three out of five?
And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not actually  from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...
Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm curious.  What does a Space Ranger actually do?
Will you quit moving around?!
How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
A lunchbox...?!
No, I'm not!  Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
I thought he was at summer camp!
Sir!  No Sir!
Yes SIR!
Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
It's busted.
That's right.  Your toys.
No, Slink --
Got it.
Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake.
Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
I knew you'd come back, Woody!
See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
She got away.
She'll have to learn.
I've got a present for you...
So had I.
Storms?
You're late for breakfast.
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
It's all right, Finn.
He's right.  They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
Arnie, thank God.
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
That's frustrating.
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
Me, too.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
Caroline --
Will we get invited to the White House?
How long's the job?
Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
Cincinnati Country Day.
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
We got you on tape making the deal. We got you bragging about the quality. We got you bragging about your business.  We got you.
Who do you work for?
She ain't in on it.
I don't know.
Nobody said shit, Eduardo --
So go shower already.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.
Then I guess I'm going by myself.
Your new friends.
No.
We agree.
But will he be house-trained?
Noriega is a criminal.
If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.
Any way we can do it better?
She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.
She hasn't called you?
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
I'm sorry... Did I wake you?
Right.  Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants...  Who knows?  Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us.  Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
What do you mean?
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
I'm off for a pish. When I come back, that money's still here, OK?
You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
You've stabbed me, man.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.
Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?
I'd fucking kill you.
Easy for you to say.
Is that a promise, then?
Smells like it.
Too young for what?
What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
Of course, the motto, the motto --
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
Aye.
No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
Right.
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
That's your theory?
Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
No, he didn't make me touch it.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
In that case --
Sure will, pal, sure will.
Went ballistic?
But where?
I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.
Pavel.
DO it. Go to Red Alert.
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
Oh, please.
Understood. Kirk out.
The power was within you.
Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
If we could send a distress signal...
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
I don't understand.
Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
Goodnight, Doctor.
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
I cannot be certain.
Who is it he reminds you of?
Why?
Yes, Captain?
Yes, Captain.
If you think it would help.
No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
I did not.
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
He did have pointed ears.
Is what possible?
Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.
It must be all those marsh melons.
It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
The ship needs its Captain.

Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
That Dillinger's on to him.
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
End of line.
I'm sorry -
The Pentagon?
What do you want with the Pentagon?
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
Greetings, program...
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
Yes.
A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
Let's get some power here.
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
We have to talk.
Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...
Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.
Strategic Air Command.
You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
Then I owe you some thanks...
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Fine.
Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
In her dreams.
Okay.  Here she comes.
Son of a bitch!
I'll just hang then, shall I?
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
I still don't believe it.
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
Sorry.
No!  Never!
I wasn't cheating!
You're not going anywhere.
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.
Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
Me too.
I'll handle it.
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
What'd you do, honey?
I can't, honey.  I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry.
I'm not wearing any.
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
You wouldn't believe me.
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
What about Juno?
Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.
And you've got one.
So what's your angle?
Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.
Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
He said he was an American agent.
Get going! 
I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
I'm sorry, I can't.
It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
It's serious.  That's all I can				* say.  Just meet on K Street under				* the Key Bridge.  At eight sharp.				*
Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
Find out who this Renquist it.
Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good?
How come?
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
There's nothing to tell.
Where are you from.
What's your favorite movie star?
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
Five.
At the movies?
You didn't do nothing.
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
What?
It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.
I heard that.
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun.
You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
Fuck you! My mother was Apache.
Get the fuck outta here!
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
You goin' out?
Every word of it.
It'll get ya high.
I know.
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
Elliot Blitzer.
Where?
What's to think about?
Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
The police department?
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
Yeah?
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
She seems very nice.
Do you still have friends on the force?
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
No shit?
No.
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
Uh-huh.
Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
Where'd you come from?
Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.
Or a supporting actor -
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
Rock whores.
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
No.
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Do you know where we can find him?
Where's that?
I didn't mean -
Uh, I didn't hear the...
We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it..."dimensions." It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused.  You don't know what's real and what's not.
This is it, James...what you've been working for.
I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
It's so clean.  No germs.
What year is it?
No more drugs.  Please...
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?
It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me.
Clues?  What kind of clues?
I've got one now.
And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
Shot!  Who shot you?
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry I locked you up.  I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!
Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?
Give me the gun.
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
I thought I was in...prison again.
You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
You... you left them a message?
In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
I need to make a telephone call.
I'm not crazy.
What's that mean?
You do know me.  You helped me once.
I'm here about some monkeys.
I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!
Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts!  Here, take this.
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
Yes, sir.
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.
I'm sorry, I didn't--
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
Christ!
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself; is it worth it?
Will be.
I don't care, just get me there.
The ticket is thirty dollars.
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
I'll give you the money!  Okay? I'll give you two-fifty.  Just . . . just, please.
Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
Yeah, you better remember that.
There you go, sweet talking me again.
Open up!
What's it to you?
Let me have a Beck's.
Genuine Draft?
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
You didn't hear something?
I'm just going to my car.
You sure you can manage?
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
Come here.
Like they're made of polyester.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
No.
Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?
You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Yeah.
I can't.
Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
You live pretty good.
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
Don't yell at me!
You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.
You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!
Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
I think I busted my leg.
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
I'm her husband.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
I had a problem getting my car back.
I do.
I did?
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
Make it twenty.
How much could you get?
You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
You didn't kill her?
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
Nothing happened with me and Grace this morning.
Christ, Jake, please--
What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
How old are you?
You expect me to believe that?
Stand up.
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
I had to beat it before the cops showed up.  I don't have a cent to my name.  I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mr. Vesci, if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have any at all.  So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car.  I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Not as bad as it looks.
What for?
Killing Jake McKenna's got to amount to something.  He wasn't much of a man, but that don't give you the right to murder him.  And don't tell me you didn't, 'cause I know you did.  I was there.  Like I said; I been watching you.
You can't do that yourself?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
All right, old man.  Christ.
Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
You afraid of the dark?
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Give it to me!
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
Grace, tell him.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
That's a solid name.
An overheated car.
Darrell's a moron.
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
Ah, I can smell it on you.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh?
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
No!
I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
What?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
You're too quick for me.
For what?
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
How old are you?
Will you shut up!
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
Don't look like nothing.
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
You've been there?
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two.
Darrell.
Maybe I don't want you to.
You sure you can manage?
You should be more careful.
No trouble at all, really.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
There is no us, remember?
Because I know you're full of shit.
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
'Cause I love you.
Harlin's.
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <u>I want it</u>.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
But, in particular?
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
How much?
What was that all about?
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.
No baby, you got it wrong.
I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
Yes.
You've made a considerably wise decision.
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
I have a lock on the door.
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
Yes. Is this David?
The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
We've already begun.
But not a knife?
Like what?
I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
We are.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
No.
No.
Get mom.
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
Is that right?
Fine.
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
And what was that explanation?
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
What wife? He don't have no wife.
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
You ain't dead.
They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
Three days. Are you hungry?
Your wife?
Be careful with those, sonny.
Those cowboys messin' him up?
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
Uh... Duke.
Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
But he was called...
You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?
Is... is it... loaded?
Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.
Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
I could of... easy.
Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.
Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
Huh?
Well... I don't recollect.
Yeah.
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
Huh?
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
We done stuff before for money, Ned.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
I know it's rainin',  Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha?
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
Tom?
The Kid, yeah...
Did I what?
What?
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
You gonna share your half with him?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
And ?
He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.
+ The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
A glass of water would be nice.
Umm ...
Then who goes?
The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
Can we stealth these guys?
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
If you'll just let me -
What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
Mr. Soze will be most -
A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
Business or personal?
Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
You didn't know.
We want to meet him.
What'the fuck is that?
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
You know damn well what I think.
Kobayashi.
Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
I told the D.A. everything I know.
I know he was good.
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
What lawyer?
The D.A. gave me immunity.
Why didn't you say anything?
Then why didn't you help him?
I said I never heard of him.
I don't
Keaton was Keyser Soze
He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
Why lie about everything else, then?
I'm not bait. No way. I post today.
As far as we know, nothing.
All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
Yes.
What does it mean?
Yes.
Yes.
Tell me one?
That's right.
...We did everything we could...
Just as you are, Sir...
No.
Through, through his book.
`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
I'm on the staff of...
Objection.
You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
I thought I would need it.
You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
No, you did fine.
Yes.  I wrote it.
Right.  Who called?
Her doctors killed her.
I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
I understand.
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
I've got nothing to say to you.
And ask me what?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
My client can't walk, your Honor.
I'm sure you would.
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Ready, your Honor.
Mr. Concannon...?
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
How come you're calling me from...?
Kathy Price.
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
Do you want me to go...?
And what makes you so tough?
What is that to you...?
He's not in, Sir.
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
... I get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --I get this expert doctor to talk to you.  I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months.  You're 'sposed to be in court.  I bet you haven't even seen the file.
What do you want?
...I'm going to need your help...
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
No.
Right.
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I can't talk now.
You use their witness.
...one of the other nurses?
The broad has disappeared...
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right.
In New York?
Hi.  How are you doing?
Yes...
Yes.
Yes.
We, we were rather busy...
How'm I doing so far?
Yes.
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
No.
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
There are things you didn't tell me.
Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
Did she hurt herself?
Who you are --
Dinner... and what else?
Okay.
I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
Honest?
No, it's not right.
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
They're none of them right.
Judy --
We'll take it! Will it fit?
You can.
Yes. Yes, I do.
Wherever you'd like...
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
How does it work?
No!
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
Some money.
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
Where had you been before?
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
You like it, too.
My name is John Ferguson.
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
Knowing I have to die...
No birds live here.
What?!
And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
Why? What's happened?
Only this far.
No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
And it's a all real.
I love you too... too late... too late...
Let me go.
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
What's tomorrow?
More than you think.
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
Why?
I'm having one now.
Uh-huh!
What a pleasant hobby.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
First of all...
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
She's dead.
Playing?
Why was the floor wet?
It's sacrilegious.
The hell you do.
They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
You fucking bastard!
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
I'm not getting a ticket.
I'm calling the ambulance.
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
There's more.
Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
Have you ever done this before?
What?
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
Any time fat boy!
I can't do this.
What?
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
I know...
It has to be done.
I don't think so.
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
Don't sweet lip me.
I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?
Doing the bachelor party thing?
Fish?
Not tonight.
I'm not talking to you?
Well, I didn't mean it.
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
I can't.
What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
He is not cracking up.
What did you ask me?
What is the question you asked me?
Say it again.
I don't know...
Yeah.
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
Moore?
What's your point?
They need leadership.
Goosed!
How about my Fatburger?
What?
I do.
Sent it.
Yup.
I think I forgot the tent.
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
Of course.
We're leaving in three hours.
I'll call them from the road.
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
Of course.
Not yet.
What are you doing?
I'm mad at you.
What!
"At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
Can we just talk this out?
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
The prostitute.
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
He's your brother.
Go for it.
I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
The wahoo moment?
How do you know she's dead.
Did she believe you?
Greenpeace?
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
That's what I'm thinking.
Yup.
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
Take your time. I wish I had.
So where to on the honeymoon?
It was an accident!
Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Two.
So you didn't come from the poorhouse!
Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
You'll think you're still at the convent.
No.
Who is she?
And this innocent child.
Thank you, Uncle.
You must listen to me before you go.
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
Yes, sir. Good night.
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
Where's the dough?
Why did he kill himself?
One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.
Are you Jorge?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
I'll be ready.
You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
Things seem to be getting better.
Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
Where?
He couldn't get through the door, then?
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
Yes!
He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
When you are, miss.
I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this.
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
I have a headache.
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
Yes, yes, I saw you!
From the terrace.
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.  Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose.  The fail-safe on—line, yet?
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
What she's going to do is get in my way.
Where's my gun?
I don't set policy.  You have the key?
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re—assignment.
Not from in here.
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
Do I get to see it or not?
It's nano—technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
How do you kill it?
Turn it down!
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
Help me get out of here.
That's not true, Parker.
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
It wasn't a lie.
Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar.
Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're re—adapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
This is my area of expertise.
Start of what?
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
Both.
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
Part of him is.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
Sid?
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
What are you talking about?
You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
<u>Lure</u> him. 
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...
I could tell you stories:  Cecil B. Demille:  Alright? The Greatest Show on Earth:  He needs an elephant,
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of... 
I don't think you're gonna need it.
They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.
What can it hurt is they offend me.
...twelve years.
Come on.
They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...
Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>...
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 
Get on this, right now...
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
<u>So</u> forth...
Y'wanna follow the Cattle Drive?  Sleep in the Winter. What does <u>Moss</u> want...?  Matchmaker comes to the Levinsky Family.  Mr. Levinsky, Mrs. Levinsky, would you entertain an offer of marriage for your son Saul, from Princess Margaret of Great Britain.  Well, they think, she isn't Jewish, but she's well to-do, a nice old family.  Alright, yes, they say.  We would consider such an offer.  Wonderful, matchmaker says, My Job is Half Done.  Now, Look:  I got the <u>file</u>, from the L.A. contingent, I got the day-by-day, of how...
Waal, I gotta tell you.  I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet.
Gloria -- sell the House.  
First of all, we're locked <u>in</u> to it, <u>secondly</u>:
It's the Pride of a Job Well Done, Stanley, yes, but it's <u>more</u> than that.
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...
How do we explain <u>that</u>?
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
CAIN, MOUTHING ALONG, WITH THE SPEECH, SHE LOOKS DOWN, AND WE SEE WRITTEN, ON HER COPY. of his making 
Dashes and Dots.  And those dots spell out a message in the Morse Code. And that message is, "Courage, Mom..."  And he got the message through. "Courage.  Mom..."  Well, to the Family of William A. Schumann, to the Men and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens <u>I</u> say "courage."  I have informed the Albanian government, and I inform <u>you</u>, that we will not rest until the safe return of Sergeant Schwn&nn.  I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old Shoe."  Ladies and Gentleman, we will not <u>treat</u> him like an Old Shoe, we...
...we will <u>not</u> be swayed, will, will not be <u>swayed</u> from <u>Every</u> effort to find <u>our</u> Old Shoe, our...
How's our friend?  What is he, "dead?"
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
Where is he?
Well, I wouldn't go up in it, lest I had to...
Who're you working for?
I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?
I have a question for you.
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
The... 
Yes.  Indeed I did. 
The men and women of Detachment Three-O-Three, with their...
I saw it on TV.
"Good Old Shoe -- "  We put him in a sweater.
Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin <u>Hats</u>?  Here's my idea....
Oh, you're gonna love this:
Haven't had so much fun since Live TV.
S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
Well, yes, but the guy <u>did</u> bring Peace.
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
What am <u>I</u> gonna do?  I'm gonna "Fade Away."  What are you gonna do?
Might, if I was asked... 
We <u>were</u> the Albanian campaign, John -- <u>We Were There</u>.
They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the <u>Wheat</u>. Variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
Eh?  I'm like the Rest of America.  I don't <u>care</u> -- I'm just <u>addicted to it</u>...
Get on your feet, boy.
Come on, Pal, come on Willie, come on, Old Shoe...
A proud tradition.
I'm looking for a phone...
Leave it flat, will you, Ben?
The Canada Thing was a shuck.  A <u>shuck</u> -- wasted a day. What can you do with Canada?  Bears, mapleleafs, "sugar -on-Snow."  Lays there on the plate like a lox.
Military Special Programs... <u>Programs</u>... No, I am not Shouting at you, I'm... I'm sorry.  Anyone named <u>Shoe</u> Schumann?  <u>Schuster</u>... uh
...one minute:  Demille needs an elephant for a reshoot.
...the pet wrangler suggested it..he's also got a...
Yes.
Yeah, good good good good good.  And They're <u>So</u> <u>Secret</u>...
By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
...they... <u>you</u> know...
...they have the capacity to Meld into the <u>Woods</u>, and...
No, no, no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten.  Um... <u>Later</u>.
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
Show some compassion.
How 'bout a Cold Drink...?
Tell those spineless toads we'll self-insure if they don't write it... You fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes...  You eating twinkies today, Bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess...
Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
No, thank you. I knew the minute I laid eyes on you, you had what it takes Bud. Just keep it going.
...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping Rock any day.
Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
All right, I owe you one Marv.
Start unloading.
50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
How's Mom?
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
Alright. Why so pissed?
Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
No, no Dixon, my client wants to buy a large, large block of stock and needs to spread it around. I'll park some money in your account and if it hits, you get a big cut. I'm telling you, this is the easiest money you ever made...
What'd you tell him?
Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
All right, Bud... let's do it.
He never told me...
Jackson, Steinem...
There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
Why do you need to wreck this company?
Excuse me.
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
Break it.
You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
Why?
No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
You guys must know something nobody else knows. If those are my plans, it's the first I've heard of it.
Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
So why are you dating Jonathan?
Hmm.
Thank you
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Too late for that sir.  Give my love to the misses.  Get those bastards!
No?
A party at a waxwork huh?
I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok.
Who's is all this?
Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.
China
Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
You guys are being real assholes
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
A ghost?
Mm-hmm.
Fine.
Well, that's what we're here for.
Yes, but...
You were in an accident?
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
I'm not...
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
This fence...it's so...
Thank you.
Yeah.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
...just so she could cut them off.
I came in from my room...
Do we have to?
I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
What are you going to do?
I know.
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
What is it?
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
I think three...
It's Saturday.
No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
Not the focus.
We did.
Of him I think.
More or less.
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
I'd never be able to live with mysel--
Mmnph.
Is it gone?
There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
What's going on, Claire?
No.  Look!  In the window.
A flare?
She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
...Don't get all...
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
Well, that's a relief.
No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
I...
What's wrong with me?
What's the matter?
Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
What?
Don't think so.
Nothing.
You don't have to do that.
Then what is he...?
Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
I want to see my mother.
Then you wear it.
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
When did she die...?
This is your aunt.  Carlotta Mayfair.  In New Orleans.
I under5tand.  All the same
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
Stop it!
I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
Like this...?
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
I love Michael...
I don't know what you are!!!
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...
Rowan...
You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-
And whose houses do you design...?
It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!
Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
God knows, I'm intriguing.
- a witch.
They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
No.    This is unreal...
- we made a fire.
Your beneficence.
What were you talking about...?
That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
You really love this guy...?
I've decided not to open a practice here  I want to set up a research clinic.  For infant genetic disorder.
As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
Then it's going to be 'I killed for sex'... Listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. You haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
CHIC MAGAZINE?
BRIAN...
And how many people have you killed?
You don't know?
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?
Did you?
It was wrong - all my life I have been cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn't have been born - I was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me...
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
Yes - I suppose so...
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
At home alone - where were you?
No worries
Oh...
I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
I better go, Dad.
Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
Do it?
Which you pulled, hard!
Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
We own a small family grocery store.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
You ordered a Winnebago?
They're in the ignition, silly.
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
Hi ho, Silver.
Whatever you want.
Of course we were.
But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
Most places are, Jimmy.
So, what brings you here at his hour?
You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
You want it in writing?
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
I meant biologically.
That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
I have absolutely no intention--
I'm trying to help.
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
Interesting.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
I doubt it.
Eventually you'll let go.
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
Maybe someday.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.
But how would we pay our bills?
Like what?
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
As much as possible.
Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
My parents always say hard work builds character.
We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.
Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
Kelly Van Ryan...
Eat a power bar.
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
What about the blood?
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
She still work there?
Was there ever any kind of investigation...
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
Suzie?
Back to the land of grownups.
Lombardo's settlement?
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
I net a guy in a bar.
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
Where's Lombardo?
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
What was that?
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
What about witnesses?
Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
I think we just need to get wasted.
Curiosity, I guess.
I would hardly say you look like trash.
Yes.  God, Mom...
I won't.
No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
Stick?
Why can't you come...
Hello.
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
That's not your line.
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
Just like that?
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
I did.  At Blue Balls.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
That's right.
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
Goodbye, Sandra.
Funny.  So am I.
Put them all together and what do we have?
Aha?
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
Where have you been?
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
My... the wild west.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
You tell me.
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?
On my way to Denver...
Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.
Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
That would be... the Mexican War?
Yes!
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
No.  I mean yes.
I don't believe you.
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
I will.
Of course!  I promise!
Time to leave.
Elora Danan!
Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
I won't.
Well what did she say?
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
Absolutely not.
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
The limitless power of...
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
More!  More!
Why?
Somebody has to do it.
Me neither!
Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!
Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
Ouch!  Let go of me!
Shut up.
How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
Maybe milking.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
...I want to say a thing.
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
Yeah.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
Home.
I can't.
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
Oh. The bullets.
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
Not long... A few days.
What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
Wrong.
Not yet.
I don't know where he is.
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
No...
I know.
I have committed no sin.
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Who are you?
You are?
I don't believe you!
Goodbye, folks!
This?
Oh!
Hickory!
No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
Catch him, you fool!
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
Has it poppies on the wall....
All hollow.  Oh --
Oh! Oh!
The nerve.
Hah!
In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Huh?  What'd he say?
Did they hurtcha?
Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
Ohhhh --
Ohhh --
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
They would?
You're going to see a Wizard?
To Oz?
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
What?
Here -- here --
Yes --- there.
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
Did you just hear what I just heard?
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
It did?
Don't you start it, too!
What's the matter?
Somebody pulled my tail.
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
It's a whatzis?
You don't neither --
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
No, sir!
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
A heart --
Dorothy!
Well, that's you all over.
Couldn’t make it. Splitting headache.
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
I was hoping you could tell me.
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
Elektra would control it all.
Perhaps after this ... test?
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. He’s a man of great integrity.
She’s not a girl anymore.
I took the initiative.
I was the one who brought that money in...
Who?
He’s not through yet. Renard doesn’t blow up five million dollars unless he knows there’s more coming in. He’s working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
Which is neutral, no doubt.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
I can’t tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
Indeed.
You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  She’s beautiful isn’t she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
Funerals aren’t exactly memorable.
It’s my father’s pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
I think you’re one of the bravest people I’ve ever met.
I have to go to work.
I think you do.
He used your exact words.
Soon she’ll be everywhere.
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
What’s your business with Elektra King?
And the payoff on the tables?
This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
Yes.  Au revoir...
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
What?!
The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
Don't call me that.
Hello, Adrian.
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
Cured, yes.
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
Those cars.  What year is this??
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
I don't think she's coming with us.
Coward.  Giving up.
Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
We should get back --  What?
-- What?
Did you know he was back on the streets?
I don't know their real names.
Then why don't you ask him?!?
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
What is that ungodly smell?
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
We're not after car thieves here.
Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
He gets to be the hero.
I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
Mind your business.
Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.
They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
Let me.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
They come in any other styles or colors?
Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
Here we go again.
Is this what you're looking for?
He's a pretty good actor, though.
This pizda? Never seen him before.
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
This is a gift. From me to you.
You wanna see my politics?
Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
Beast.
Its core?
I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
Suit yourself.
What do you want?
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
I'll go.
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
Enough for a test.
ALIVE.
And I'll never understand terrorists.
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
It does indeed, Max.
I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
Yes, my dear, he is.
You have the wrong house.
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
Yes, sir?
I did, sir.
Baack!
Well... yes.
I...
Oh, darling -- so will I.
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
Is it worth taking a chance?
It seems fine.
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
Why did you do that?
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
How old are you, young man?
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
But they told me it was Ee gor.
Yes, just the two.
I beg your pardon?
What wockers?
I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
What?
What?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
Was he any good?
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
You've got it, master.
This guy means business.
What?
Wait till he sees the bill.
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.
Give -- me -- your -- hand!
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
I'm not trying to be funny.
... I'm glad that's...
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
I'll bet it's a doozy.
Is everything ready?
It's alive!
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
... It's.
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
...Su-per du-per. Come let's mix where Rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber- el-las' in their mitts.........................
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
We only arrived a few minutes ago.
Well...
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
What a filthy mess.
Well, this explains the music.
Perhaps we'd better leave.
I thought it was wonderful.
I think you've done it, master.
Are you serious??
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
Why don't we talk inside?
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
Four
Yes.
I listened extra careful to your "Stand To" this mornin', Boy. ft was peifecL I couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye?
So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.

But will they make good use of them?
Thank you.
Yes.
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
Keep steady. You're the best shots of the Twenty-Fourth. You bunch of heathens, do it
And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
